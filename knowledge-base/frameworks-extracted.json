Ernest Hemingway.The first picture you see inside my book is a picture of me standing in front of my gym, and a picture of where I used to sleep on the gym floor. I stared at the ceiling in the dark. Alone. I had no one to go to.It sounds cool when you tell the story later, but it didn't feel that way. I was terrified. I went against my father's wishes.I skipped out on business school. I spent all my savings. Everyone I cared about told me not to do it. I was the idiot that gave up on a good career. I thought I would look forward to the struggle, but it got real fast.Kids partied all night in the parking garage above me. They'd race over the steel dividers. It sounded like gunshots echoing in my concrete bedroom. And as soon as I started to pass out, I get jolted awake by another bang, bang, bang bang I finally gave up trying to sleep at night.I settled for midday naps in the utility closet. Then in the dead of night, I worked. I had to make money. My gym set across the street from a large storage unit business.The owner became one of my few members, only out of convenience. A few weeks after he joined, he pulled me aside after his workout. I've been doing a little math, he said.It looks like you're struggling. I tried to hide my embarrassment, but I failed. All right, kid. Let's grab breakfast tomorrow. I hesitated, thinking about my bank account. Before I could answer, he said, don't worry, my treat \\[...0.5s\\] relief.The next morning, we met at the local diner around 5:00am. As a waitress brought our coffee, he asked, how much time you got left to live, \\[...0.6s\\] huh? How much cash you got saved up? About five grand. How much time does that give you before you run out?I thought about it for a moment. About a month. Tough. How you getting customers? I have a$39 six week special on a discount site. How many customers have you gotten? Four. Looks like you've got a problem that you need to solve fast. He let the statement sink in, \\[...0.4s\\] then I saw a grin spread across his face.Let me ask you a question. How much does a free month of storage cost? I shrugged. Uh, nothing. He took note of my confusion and said, all right, let's go for a ride. I'll explain it at my facility.As soon as we walked in, the girl at the front desk greeted us. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Judy. How much does a free month of storage cost? He asked. One, 20, seven, sir, she replied cheerfully. He smiled, and he turned to me. Want to know how? I nodded. He took me through the office and down one of the rows of freshly painted units.So, we advertise the first month is free, and it is.But what's the first thing you need after you get a storage unit? I don't know. I shrugged.Exactly, nobody really does, but I do. And I help him out. So let me give you a hint. He pointed towards the lock on the door. Right? A lock, \\[...0.7s\\] yeah, and not one of those flimsy locks that kids use on their lockers. Those won't fit here. Anyways. Besides, any goon with bolt cutters can get through those in a second, but not one of these bad boys. He tapped the lock to emphasize his point. \\[...1.4s\\] Yeesh, it looks like it. Where do you even get one of those?I asked. Funny, you should ask. I've got a whole storage unit full of these. Yours today for just 47 bucks. Okay, okay, I get it. They come in for the free month, but what good is a storage unit unless you can lock it exactly? He said, \\[...0.7s\\] I get it. So where does the other 80 bucks come from?Great memory. So what else you gonna want? I shrugged. Well, if you have stuff to store, you're gonna need boxes to store it in. But never fear, we've got boxes with tons of different shapes and sizes to fit all your storage needs. We also offer tape labels and heavy duty markers to make sure you know exactly what's in every box and where you put it.Super handy. Oh duh, that makes perfect sense. I said, \\[...0.8s\\] what else you gonna need? He asked, \\[...0.5s\\] I don't know. Uh, help moving it?Yes, now we don't actually offer in house moving services, but we have an affiliate relationship with a local moving business and make a kickback. And if you wanna move all your stuff yourself, that's fine too. We have dollies, hand trucks, straps and other useful tools available for a fee. After all, why buy a bunch of stuff you only use once?What a waste\\! \\[...1.1s\\] Oh yeah, I didn't think of that. I said, \\[...0.8s\\] what else are you gonna want? He asked. Uh, I really don't know.Well, \\[...0.4s\\] what you store is viable, right? At least valuable to you in some way. I mean, if it wasn't, you'd send it all the dump, so you're gonna want some insurance in case something bad happens.Now I already give$500 of free insurance to all customers, but if you have one of the special locks only I offer, I'll bump$200,000 for only an extra$10 a month, he puffed with pride, \\[...0.6s\\] Dang and all that adds up to 127 bucks.Yep, but we're not done yet. You know what always seems to happen onto his game? Now I played along beats me.What happens? Everyone has way more stuff than they think, and they always rent too small of a unit. In fact, it happens so often, we always offer one size up. They get the space they need, and we make a few extra bucks. It works out for everyone.Wow, this is pretty cool. I didn't know any of this stuff, of course not. He said, why would you \\[...0.8s\\] fair enough, but how do I use this to grow my gym? I asked, \\[...0.7s\\] yeah, I've been playing this game as long as you've been alive.And when you figure out how to make money in one business, I mean, really figure it out. You see ways to make money in any business, \\[...0.5s\\] and one thing's for sure, the longer you play, the more you learn.Wow, so you've had this place for 23 years. This place, no, this is just one of my newer locations. You have more than one? I asked, I have 27\\. Oh \\[...0.4s\\] crap, \\[...0.4s\\] I felt 2 inches tall. Anyways, I gotta get to work, you know, your way out, you pointed to the door.Yeah, I chuckled. I think I can make it across the street. \\[...1.7s\\] Two and a half years later, \\[...0.8s\\] I now had six gyms, I had leveled up. I wanted to level up again, so I paid$25,000 for an hour of time with famous marketer. I never spoken to him, but I knew his stuff like the back of my hand.I had one goal for this call for him to help me scale my gyms. After brief introductions, we dove it, \\[...0.8s\\] so, yeah, and that's how I open my gyms at full capacity on day one, I put$3,000 down for a lease, and then run a few days worth of ads.I sell customers in the empty building, then the cash from those sign UPS goes towards more ads, equipment, paint, flooring, furniture, signage and whatever else the location needs. Doing it this way, I've opened up a new location every 6 months with no debt.Wow, so cool, explain to me in a bit more detail, would you? His business was making millions of bucks a month. Those numbers blew my mind, and he wants to hear how I advertise.I beamed with bride. I advertise a free six week challenge until I get about 20 leads a day. Got it, keep going, he said. About half the lead show for appointments. I sell half of those who show into a 600 dollar program, so about 25% of my leads become paying customers.I also get about another 80 bucks in profit per customer from supplement sales, \\[...0.4s\\] not too shabby. Agreed, he grunted. So you make, like, 680 bucks percussion before you even open your doors. Pretty dang good, but you left something out. What did I leave out? How much you paying for late?Oh, 5 bucks \\[...0.8s\\] if a deafening silence ever happened in my life, this was it. He stuttered a bit. So you put$1 in and get$34 out in 48 hours. Yeah, is that good? I asked. It's amazing, he said. Do you have anything happening on the back end?I grinned ear to ear. Yeah, a few weeks later, I tell them that they can get their$600 back as credit if they choose to sign up for a year.Two thirds of sign UPS convert into memberships, so I end up with a full gym in$20,000 a month \\[...0.4s\\] of recurring memberships for$3,000 down. Then I rinse and repeat.Wait a second, you do all this in 30 days. Yeah, pretty cool, right? He rubbed his eyes. You shouldn't be running gems.Oh god, I thought he was going to compliment me, but he told me I should quit. My mind raised. Alex, he said, snapping me back into reality. You have a level 10 skill set in the level 2 opportunity.Okay, well what should I do? I asked. You shouldn't be running gyms, you should be showing other gym owners how to do what you just showed me. I hated the idea of giving up on what took years to build, but he made a lot more money than I did. I figured if I ignored his advice, I may as well burn my money.So I took his advice. Over the next nine months, I closed down my newest gym and sold my other five. They give me all the time to go all in on my new company, Gym Watch. Over the next two years, I flew around the country, turning gyms around.Then, after 30+ turnarounds, I switched to a licensing model. I no longer flew out in person. Instead, \\[...0.4s\\] I helped them follow our proven model to fill their gyms and increase profits.A small market to be sure, but they were starving some literally. But once they filled their gym in 30 days, they told their friends. Gym wash took off like a rocket. It was wild.Over the next five years, I took over$43 million in owner distributions. Then I sold 66% of the company at 46.2 million in an all cash deal. With that deal, I crossed$100 million a net worth at age 31\\. And to be clear, no one was more surprised than me \\[...0.5s\\] from there.My wife and I founded our family office. Acquisition.

It spans brick and mortar, change software services and e commerce.And even though we worked in many different niches, our companies have all grown using the same principles I share in this book.So \\[...0.4s\\] what's in it for you \\[...0.6s\\] in a few pages that took you from sleeping on the floor to crossing$100 million in net worth. So the natural question is how answer \\[...0.5s\\] by making more money from customers than it cost to get them.

Pro tip: faster deeper learning by reading and listening at the same time. Here's a life hack I stumbled on years ago. If you listen to an audiobook and read the physical book or ebook at the same time, you read faster and remember more. You store the content in more places in your brain.Nifty stuff. This is how I read books worth reading. I also do both because I struggle to stay focused. If I listen to the audio while reading it, it helps me avoid zoning out. It took me two days to record this book out loud. I did it, so if you struggle like me, you don't have to anymore.If you wanna give it a try, go ahead and grab the audio version and see for yourself. I've made my books as cheap as the platforms let me, so this is an employ to make some extra coin.I promise. I hope you find it as valuable as I have. I figured I'd put this hack early on, this way you'd have a chance to do it if you found the first chapter valuable enough to earn your attention.Pro tip \\[...0.5s\\] hack for finishing books. I get distracted easily, so I need little tricks to keep my attention. This one helps me a lot. Finish chapters, don't stop in the middle. Completing a chapter gives you positive reinforcement, keeps you going.So if you meet a tough chapter, finish it so you can start fresh on the next one. Section 1: what's a money model? \\[...1.3s\\] Hermozi has the highest return on advertising of any business using her advertising tracking platform, by a mile.He is the biggest discrepancy between dollars spent and dollars earned, and we only work with business suspending at least 250,000 per year on marketing or more. So these are the cream of the crop marketers, and his numbers earn the stratosphere by comparison.Alex Becker, CEO, Hiros, \\[...0.7s\\] December 2019: hello sir, \\[...0.5s\\] can I have your ID so I can look up your reservation? The car rental agent said, smiling.I already had my ID in hand, ready. So I slid it across the counter. Hmm, \\[...0.5s\\] looks like we don't have your car reserved. We have an equivalent car though. And you're a big guy, would you prefer a roomier pickup instead?Blinking a few times, \\[...1.0s\\] yeah, that sounds nice, I said. \\[...1.1s\\] I've got you down here for three days. She cocked her head to the side a bit. Would you like to have a late return so you can turn in the vehicle at any time during the day without worrying about late fees? I pulled up my schedule, my phone. Yeah, we have an evening flight. That sounds good.Great, give me a second, just putting that in. So would you like better insurance to cover any bumps and scratches on the car? It covers any and all damage the vehicle during your time. Nope, I'm good. No plans on drag racing while I'm here, I joked. So only the minimum insurance then?Yeah, that's all I need. Okay, then \\[...0.6s\\] I'll have your keys in a second. Did you want us to take care of fuel so you don't have to worry about filling it up? You can return it on empty and not worrying about paying a fee. We do it for three dollars and seventy five cents a gallon. What's gas cost around here? I asked. About 3\\. 50 a gallon, she replied cheerfully.Sure, why not. I hate filling it up when I'm rushing to catch a flight. Alrighty, then here's your receipt. Just go around the corner and your truck should be halfway down to the left. Enjoy your trip\\! \\[...1.1s\\]As I walked, I glanced at the receipt. It stopped me in my tracks. I could only laugh at myself. I came for a$19 a day car and I left paying$100 a day, a 5 x difference.And that's the power of a well designed money model. They knew everything I wanted before I asked, \\[...0.4s\\] and when they asked to solve problems I didn't even know I would have I accepted \\[...1.0s\\] a money model happened.A money model is a sequence of offers at their core. We find every opportunity to solve a customer's problems and then offer to solve it.For that reason, money models tend to have many offers in a specific order. If you offer the right thing when customers realize they need it, you can make as many offers as you like.This is the rental car company's money model stated plainly. Offer 1: vehicle upgrade, offer 2: late return offer 3: premium insurance, offer 4: minimum insurance downsell offer 5: prepaid gas. So yeah, I paid more, but it also solved more problems. Let's break down the problem she solved.First, she solved my big man in small car problem by offering a vehicle to have more space. Then she solved my late checkout problem by offering the flexibility to keep vehicle longer.Then she solved my worries about digging the car problem by offering insurance to protect against it. Then she solved my risk of missing my flight problem by offering a way to prepay for the gas ahead of time so I wouldn't have to do it on my ride back. And all of those things cost money that I was happy to pay.The rental car company thought out every nuance. They thought about every problem, then made their solution available to me. The offer solutions for higher fees and hassles I might have had later for smaller fees in total right now.As result, my 19 dollar rental became 100 dollar rental. I paid more money faster. And now we can see why rental car industry brings in billions in the United States alone per month.A successful money model, \\[...0.9s\\] beware, \\[...0.8s\\] bad money models kill businesses. It cost many businesses more to get somebody to buy a thing than they make and profit off the thing. In other words, they lose money getting new customers. That's a big problem. And here's what happens. They spend money to get customers.At the end of the month, they realize they spent more than they made. They cut back on advertising to get fewer customers than they can handle because they can't afford them, then cut advertising all together.Float the business with personal cash loans, credit, and then pray for profit. Sell percentages of their business just to keep the lights on. Wait months or years to make their money back, if ever fall further and further behind until finally they lose it all.It doesn't have to be that way. There's plenty of money, you just have to go get it. In traditional business, the slow drip of profits from lots of customers eventually pays for a single customer.This drip starves the business of cash. It means they can only get customers through advertising if they already have lots of customers. Big companies or small companies with investors can do this because they have the money to burn.Think about it this way. If you spend$100 in advertising to get a customer and make$500 in profit from them, that's a great deal, you should take it all day. But what if it takes you two years to make your cash back?It's a great business if you already have tons of cash in the bank. Otherwise, you're gonna run out of money. That leaves you with two options. Option 1, wait two years to get paid and pray you don't run out of money.Option 2, get paid fast and grow as much as you done while please a good money model is option two. \\[...1.0s\\] Author note: \\[...0.4s\\] make enough profit to cover your costs in 30 days or less. I like to cover my costs of getting a customer within 30 days.Main reason. Any business can get interest free money for 30 days in the form of credit card if you clear your balance before the end of the month, it works just like normal money.So you can use credit to get a customer, pay it back, and then use it again to get the next customer. And if you can pay it off before 30 days, you can do it again, \\[...0.6s\\] rinse and repeat.Good money models make millionaires. \\[...1.5s\\] If you make more offers and people buy them, you make more money. If you make more money, you can use it to get more customers. If they pay you that money faster, the faster you can get those customers and stay profitable.But what if you make your customers twice as viable, you get twice as many of them, and you get those customers at twice the speed. Your business grows eight times faster, and if you triple them, your business grows 27 times faster.See where I'm going with this, you can get really big, really profitable, really fast with just a few changes. And that's exactly what I'm gonna show you how to do.Next up \\[...0.8s\\] money models are sequence of offers. Different offers solve different problems, so if you wanna win, \\[...0.4s\\] you have to figure out what to offer.Next to figure that out, you've got to understand the four types of offers, \\[...0.7s\\] the four types of offers that make money models stop being poor Paris Hilton the limit does not exist, \\[...0.7s\\] Lindsay Lohan as Kitty Heron in Mean Girls. \\[...1.1s\\]Making one offer works better than making none, and making more offers works better than making one.Combining offers in a sequence makes a money model. My money models combine 4 different types of offers. 4 types of offers. Here are 4 types of offers attraction offers upsell offers downsell offers and continuity offers. All improve our money model, but they do it differently. They work great on their own, but together they make your business unstoppable.If you look at a great business, you'll see different versions of these offers as core components of their money making machine. You can use 1, 2, multiples of one or all four together. You can combine them however you want. But when I look at my most profitable businesses, I use all four.Here's why. If you don't have an offer for getting customers, you won't get as many. But let's see you do. If you only have that one thing to offer, you won't make nearly as much money as you could.So if you have something to offer next and up, so you'll finally get some cash, but you still won't make as much money as you could, because lots of people still say no. So you turn those nos into yeses with down cells.And that works fine, but it would be even better if we get that extra cash guaranteed to come in month after month. So you make a continuity offer to top it off.That's how I like to do it. So that's how I structured these sections. I start with the traction offers because if you're not getting customers, you need one of those first. Then \\[...0.4s\\] we cover upsell offers followed by downsell offers.Then to finish the four types. I show you my favorite continuity offers, exactly how I learn them. How each chapter is structured. Here's how the rest of book reads. 1\\. The story of how I first Learned this money model. 2\\. A description of how the money model works. 3.A few examples of how this money model works in different industries. Think of how you could use money model in your business. Four important notes and tactics that make the money model work. These tidbits help you execute the play like it's your hundredth time doing it on your first try. 5.A summary all the important points about the money model, plus some extra thoughts sprinkled in about how to make the money model work even more profitably. \\[...1.7s\\] Important notes: \\[...0.6s\\] all right, before I release this pile of golden nuggets, I need to make a few things clear.No. 1, all businesses have money models. It makes a business a business. Switch the poor person mantra of this won't work for my business to the rich person mantra of how will I make this work for my business? They all work.Be creative. 2\\. Some money models work better in some businesses than others. They're just different ways to offer stuff. If you just try and copy what they do, you'll be disappointed. To make it work for your business, you have to design your own. But don't worry, I'll show you how.3. If a customer asks for their money back, give it back. Avoid the headache. And if you made a goof, fix the goof. Don't be a silly goose. Treat customers well. Spend the time and resources getting a customer better fit for your business.4. Hard selling is for weak products. If someone doesn't want something, that's okay. Don't convince someone against their will. Make offers available at the time your customer has a problem, and you'll be ahead of the competition. If they don't want it, no sweat. Find somebody who does. It's a numbers game. \\[...1.0s\\] 5.Obey the law: I learn these plays in different situations from different people, using it on different platforms, in different times, in different places, following different rules.Advertising laws change all the time, and they tend to only get tighter, especially when it comes to the word free.

Enjoy\\!Section 2: attraction offers how to turn eyeballs into money. Attraction offers generate leads and convert them into customers. They turned advertising into money by offering something free or at a discount.We do this because everyone wants a great deal. In a great deal, customers get far more value than the price they pay. Strangers can only take your word on the value, but they absolutely understand the price. For that reason, discounts make anything a great deal to just about anyone. And the greater the discount, the better the deal.The greatest discount of all being free, free and discount work interchangeably.First off, anytime I say free, you can use discount or$1. Anytime I use discount, you can also use free or$1, and so on. They all discount a product to some level, even if you discount 100%. If you can imagine a way to use a discount or free offer, then you can do it. After that, I'll let you use your noggin to exchange them \\[...0.4s\\] as you see fit.So how do you make money by offering free stuff? Think about it this way. People look for one thing and then buy another by accident all the time. Attraction offers get them to do it on purpose. But what's a better deal than free stuff more and better free stuff? One free thing is awesome.Two free things are awesome. Er, \\[...0.5s\\] and maybe to get those two free things, they have to buy one. That's how we make money on free stuff in this section, I go over my five favorite ways to make money by offering free stuff. No. 1, win your money back. No. 2, giveaways. No. 3, decoy offer. No. 4, buy X, get y free.No. 5, pay less now or pay more later. Let's make some money \\[...0.8s\\] free gift \\[...0.6s\\] bonus tutorial on attraction offers.I made a free video for you on how to attraction offers work. If you want it, just go to acquisition. Com for training for money. There's no option required, enjoy. When your money back, if you do X or achieve y within Z days, you can get it free.June 2013, \\[...0.8s\\] I was in a room full of experience gym owners, and I was the new guy. We all took turns talking about what was working.Well, that's when Danny piped up. Yeah, so as you guys know, I've been struggling with sales, and I think I got it figured out. I had this pain in the butt guy \\[...0.4s\\] who wouldn't buy anything. He knew he needed it, but he also said he needed more accountability.So we're going back and forth, and you finally came to me with this idea. You said how about this, I'll give you$500, you train me for eight weeks.If I hit my goal, I get my money back, but in return, you can use my results to market your business. Fair enough, I figured what the heck he wasn't gonna buy anyways, so I said sure. So what happened? I asked, \\[...0.4s\\] he hit the goal, \\[...0.4s\\] so he gave me his money back.Yeah, Danny said I cut him, so what, then he just left. That's what you think, but he ended up using the money to buy more time, \\[...0.7s\\] seems decent enough. What about marketing's results, dude, making his workouts public and posting his before and after pictures brought 13 referrals. Oh, that's insane.Now we're talking, yeah, I know I offer this to everyone, now the results are way better. People love the offer, and all the free advertising they do gets us their friends and family to join too. I'm making more money than ever.This is the first time I ever saw an offer like this. I updated it over time, but the course did the same pay now with a chance to get your money back later. I used it for private training, group training, private nutrition coaching, and group nutrition coaching.And once I saw how well it worked with my customers, I started putting the offer in my ads for new customers. My cost of getting customers went way down, and my leads exploded. Description \\[...0.6s\\] a win, your money back offer works like this, you set a goal for the customer and tell them how to reach it.If they reach it, then they qualify to get their money back or \\[...0.4s\\] get it back in store credit.This offer grew my gyms better than any other, it was also the first grand same offer gym watch taught to gym owners. It has tons of flexibility, so if you wanna get more cash, get more customers, and get the better results, nothing beats it \\[...0.8s\\] to win your money back.The person has three options, get results, \\[...0.6s\\] take actions, or both. And to make this work, you have to make the results and actions simple to track.Results: \\[...0.5s\\] here, no matter what they do, if the customer gets the result, they win their money back. For example, making X dollars a month, getting why customers, losing Z pounds, etc. Basically, they bet on their ability to reach the goal.Actions: \\[...0.5s\\] here, you hold them accountable for doing actions instead of getting results. No matter what results they get, if the customer does what you ask, they win their money back.For example, attend all sessions, calls, meeting, log progress, take pictures, do assigned homework, etc. Here, they bet in their ability to follow instructions.Actions and results: \\[...0.7s\\] here, you hold the customers accountable to following directions and getting results. If they do both, they win their money back.Often people wanting to achieve a goal have too few skills to do it. Even if they did bet on themselves, they'd fail. By setting a good goal for them and showing them how to reach it, they have a fighting chance. Here they bet on their ability to follow directions and that your directions will get them the result.Bottom line: \\[...0.5s\\] customers put money down if they do the stuff or get the result or both, they get it back as cash or store credit.Examples: \\[...0.7s\\] business to consumer: offer free 28 day blueprint. Deposit x dollars and get it all back if \\[...0.4s\\] you: \\[...0.6s\\] 1\\. Attend all the consulting calls. 2\\. Post your progress in the group once per week. 3\\. Journal daily inner app. 4\\. Attend your feedback section. Inter transformation session, hit \\[...0.4s\\] calls and meetings become opportunities to make more offers.Next example: \\[...0.8s\\] business to business: offer \\[...0.5s\\] 5 customers and 5 days free challenge. Deposit X dollars and get it all back if you: \\[...0.4s\\] 1\\. Send 100 messages a day. 2\\. Report stats on messages sent. 3\\. Attend daily trainings.4. Post finished homeworking group. 5\\. Attend 5 day consulting call. Hint: \\[...0.7s\\] here you offer more better or new products and services. \\[...1.3s\\] Example No. 3: physical product offer: \\[...0.4s\\] put one million miles on your car and get a free car.So you get a free car if you: 1\\. Buy a new car from us. 2\\. Drive the car a million miles. 3\\. Turn it in. 4\\. Take pictures \\[...0.4s\\] and be in a press release. 5\\. Will credit all your original purchase towards your next car. This was an actual offer by Volvo years ago. \\[...1.2s\\] Important notes: \\[...0.8s\\] this offer has generated$1 billion in sales.It works. I have made a lot of money with it. You can too. When your money back works with new, current, and previous customers. I like to use it with new customers because it offers the steepest discount possible, 100%.I like it with current customers because it mixes them in with new customers. And I like to use it to get previous customers back because bigger incentives get them to come back.It works well with stuff that people start and quit, like starting a business, learning new skills, losing weight building, fitness, beauty regimes, self care, time management, mental health management, etc. It keeps motivation during the early pains \\[...0.6s\\] of learning. To this day, I've never seen a better way of setting up a program for results. A true win.Win. \\[...1.1s\\] Don't worry, this offer makes some money. If you did give all the money back, this offer would make money. But it does.First, many won't qualify even with realistic conditions.Second, those who do qualify often stay as customers, but they can only stay customers if they have something else to buy.So have an UPS already to apply their winnings to which I'll cover in Section 4\\. Even more, \\[...0.6s\\] only offer when your money back, if you feel okay with giving money back refunds are part of doing business.However, when advertise well, the, when your money back offer gets tons of extra customers, and when you give satisfied customers a great follow up offer, you make plenty of profit. This more than outweighs the refunds.From the data we've collected from thousands of gyms. About 10% of all customers will ask for their money back. If you can't stomach that, don't do this. \\[...1.2s\\] Offer store credit instead of cash.If you don't want to offer cash back, you can offer store credit instead. My testing showed offering store credit and cash back at the same number of customers, so you might as well offer store credit.But if she still wanna advertise free, pair it with an unconditional satisfaction guarantee, adding the unconditional guarantee never materially affected the people who wanted their money back. Check with legal counsel in the area.Of course, \\[...0.6s\\] don't take blood money if someone doesn't want me to have their money, I want it even less than they do. As a personal rule, if a customer asks for refund entitled or not, I give it to them. Just focus on getting the next customer. How to create your, win your money back criteria.These criteria make or break this offer. Good criteria have three characteristics: 1\\. They're easy to track, so train them on exactly what they need to do, or they will mess it up. Bonus points if people already do it. Example, \\[...0.5s\\] phones already track steps, word processors already track word count, cameras automatically date photos, \\[...0.8s\\] etc.Get customers results, \\[...1.0s\\] make criteria likely to get them to their desired results. Realistic criteria do just fine.If you think the criteria looks too easy, you've probably gotten close to realistic. They may take a few tries to get it right, but so does anything worth making. Examples: attend meetings, workouts, watch videos, etc.Whatever the best customers do to get the best results, make everyone do it, and they'll get great results too.3. Advertise the business: make advertising the business part of your criteria. For example, posting about their participation, tagging in social media, referring or leaving reviews and testimonials.How you apply store credit: this is important \\[...0.7s\\] when customers win their money back. Offer to apply it over a longer period or a bulk package. Just offer to apply it to something that cost more than their winnings.In my experience, this keeps customers engaged and makes you more money. So here's what it looks like: you have a product or service that cost$200 a month.A customer wins$600 of credit. Avoid giving them three months free upfront, instead apply the$600 over 12 months. So$600 divided by 12 months is a fifty dollar per month credit. Now they pay$200 per month minus the 50 dollar credit \\[...0.4s\\] for a total of$150 a month.To be clear, they can use the credit however they want, but I recommend that you present this first.If they ask to use it up front, you can share my perspective, which is that people fall off if they don't pay something. A discount over the long haul keeps them engaged over the long haul. So it's in the customer's best interest to keep some skin in the game.In depth details on this upsell offer in the roll over Upsell chapter in Section 4\\. All meetings and calls provide opportunities to make more offers.Make checking meetings part of your money back criteria whenever you can. And make all meetings required to win their money back \\[...0.4s\\] beyond helping them succeed. They are the best opportunities to make upsell offers.So after you've checked in offer what makes sense based on their feedback, \\[...0.4s\\] the win your money back offer.And my gyms had three appointments \\[...0.5s\\] nutrition orientation, which is before pictures where I'd make a supplement offer, \\[...0.5s\\] progress check in where I'd make a membership offer, and transformation feedback, which was after pictures where I'd make a membership offer again.And if they bought the membership at the last meeting, offered a discount if they prepaid the year. \\[...1.2s\\]Make everyone a winner. Promote and sell a program as though they will only get it back if they meet the criteria, \\[...0.4s\\] but about halfway through, make your next offer as if they've already won. You lower the customer's anxiety about failing and you keep them longer. They'll also love you that much more. It goes something like this.I know you're trying to hit this short term goal, but what's your long term goal?Okay, that's great to hear you get that. It's not about this short term program, but about your long term results. So I'll tell you what to show you how much I want you to hit your long term goal. I'll credit this program towards the next one, whether you hit the short term goal or not.How's that sound? And then you sign them up right there for the long term thing before they even finish. At the end of the program, let the losers win.If someone refuses your first upset and fails the challenge, you can still upset them again.Here's how \\[...0.5s\\] act like they won. I say something like this, don't worry about it. You started, that's the biggest victory of all, and even though you didn't hit your short term goal, you met hours which was finishing what you started to show you that we're in this for the long haul, will credit your entire deposit towards staying with us long term. That way you get your money back and you can still hit your goal.How does that sound? You'll turn that frown upside down, and they'll love you for it. Remember, we don't get customers to make a sale, we make sales to get customers. The win your money back offer has a simple structure with lots of flexibility \\[...0.5s\\] at its heart.You offer product or service and a way for customers to get their money back if they actually use it. Then if they use it the way you suggest, they will get good enough results and stay open to more offers and or longer term commitments.Summary points, \\[...0.6s\\] win your money back is magical for businesses that require customers to put in continuous effort to get their ideal outcome.The win your money back offer rocks because you get loads of upfront cash, you get more customers say yes to you since it's lower risk, you get massive results for customers, you get more long term customers, they advertise your offers to get you even more customers, \\[...0.4s\\] making some meetings a part of getting the deposit back, give great opportunities to check in with your customers and make more offer specific to their needs.Everyone thinks businesses make money on people who fail this program. No, the real money comes from people who succeed with it, and you have something else to offer them. Trust me on this one, \\[...0.4s\\] the more results you deliver, the more money you'll make. Think long.Make the refund criteria easy to track, align with the customer's goals, and helpful to the business. Only use them when your money back offer if your refund rate is currently below 5%, otherwise fix your product before doing this, you'll risk getting too many refunds.Put the store credit towards another, preferably more expensive offer. You want them to stay customers, so give them the opportunity. You never want people to stop paying you \\[...0.7s\\] to make more sales and keep more customers.Make everyone a winner in private. That way everyone stays surprised and grateful when you make your up sale. Offer \\[...0.6s\\] free gift, win your money back.

This description is no way a guarantee of lawfulness. I take no responsibility for anything you do or don't do as a result of reading this chapter. Woo, okay, got that out of the way.August 2020, I hopped on the phone with the owner of a fitness certification business to talk shop. In a few minutes, he gave me the rundown about how they certify fitness enthusiasts and help them find clients. Interesting business you've got, I said. How do you get leads? \\[...1.1s\\]Well, it's pretty simple. We advertise a full ride scholarship for our tire program. People apply with their contact information and then answer a few questions we ask stuff like, \\[...0.4s\\] why should we pick you for the full ride scholarship? The best answer gets a full ride. But we also do something more \\[...0.4s\\] nice.Keep going. I said \\[...0.7s\\] we give out partial scholarships. What do you mean? How's that work? Well, we often have a clear winner for the full ride, but tons of people have inspiring stories, so I wanna make sure they get scholarships too.Now I can only give away one full ride, but I can give away as many partial scholarships as I want. And then it hit me, \\[...0.6s\\] oh, so lots of people apply for the grand prize and only one person gets that, but the other applicants qualify for smaller prices. Right?So I make a big deal out of the person who wins the full ride scholarship, but then I call everyone else to let them know they got the partial scholarship.When I talk to them, they're thrilled. Most of them join our program on the spot, so they don't know the actual price of your thing when they hop on the call.Nope, \\[...0.4s\\] but they know the value of the school ride scholarship. And then when you present the discounted price of your program with the partial scholarship, it's still a huge savings exactly.So not only do you get tons of engaged leads, but you also get more customers with your surprise discount genius.It works really well. We actually have to cap it to make sure we can service all the new sign UPS. Believe it or not, we teach the same plate of trainers that we certify it works just as well to get fitness customers and sometimes even better.Man, I love it. He presented this as an education offer and as a fitness offer, but it's so much more. I'm gonna show you how to use it in any business. Free giveaways generate many leads who show interest in your most expensive product. What could be better \\[...0.9s\\] description?Giveaway offers advertise a chance to win a big prize in exchange for your content information and whatever else you want. Then after picking a winner, you offer everyone else the big prize at a discounted price.Giveaways also go by names like Scholarship, Sweepstake and raffles. They all mean enter for a chance to win.To run a giveaway offer, you pick a grand prize, pick your promotional offer, ask for contact information and other eligibility criteria, pick what actions you want entrance to take to qualify for the big prize, put the giveaway on a deadline to add urgency, announce the grand prize winner, and contact everyone else.Let's go into each with more detail. Pick a grand prize. Make your grand prize the thing you want everyone to buy. Make sure you assign a monetary value to your grand prize to serve as a price anchor. For instance, if you sell$5,000 worth of value for$2,000, then advertise the 5,000 dollar value.Next, \\[...0.8s\\] pick your promotional offer. Your promotional offer takes the place of the partial scholarship in the story. You create it by enhancing your core offer with a discount, a bonus, or by mindily changing it from the grand prize in order to ethically justify a price reduction, using the grand prize as a price anchor. And the bigger the discount, the more compelling the offer. So the bigger the value, describe your grand prize, the better.Remember, Leeds entered the giveaway because they found the grand prize interesting. It gets you qualified Leeds because you offer what they already showed interest in at a discount.Call your promotional offer the thing you sell to everyone else, whatever you want for your giveaway, scholarship, gift card, dollars off, store credit vouchers, etc. \\[...1.2s\\] Next, \\[...0.5s\\] ask for contact information in exchange for chance to win.Ask for permission to contact them in any way you please for follow promotions. Beyond that, I survey for prize eligibility and then ask them to take qualifying actions. So what's eligibility \\[...0.6s\\] if I ask them if there are fit for my products, like do you own a vet clinic? Or more character slash need based questions like why should you be selected?Ask for qualifying actions, those are other stuff entrance due to qualify to win. I also use these to get them to promote my giveaway more or demonstrate higher levels of interest. Example, attending a call or event, making a post, entering group, etc. Put the giveaway on a deadline to add urgency.Set a date for the grand prize drawing. Make your giveaway more urgent by only making it available for limited time. I like 3 to 7 days from the day I start promoting it. As soon as leads enter the giveaway, update them daily.First, let them know how long they have left until you announce the winner. You can do this with email, direct messages, tag, social media post, and so on. Do as many times as reasonable, once a day across all platform works fine.Second, provide value along with your countdown. Show everyone the benefits of the grand prize, how excited they should be, and refer everyone to social proof, keep the hype alive.Pro tip, \\[...0.4s\\] Whisper Tea Shop. Once people enter the free giveaway, it may help to think of the countdown like a mini product launch. So check out the affiliates and partners chapter of 100 million dollar leads for detailed look on launches. Announce the grand prize winner and start contacting everyone else.Announce the grand prize winner publicly, then message everyone else who qualifies for your core offer privately. The beauty is everybody else qualifies for a promotional offer, notify them by text, email and direct messages.In that message, ask them to schedule a call visit because they qualified for something.If you need a reason, just say that you found their answers restore so compelling you felt obligated to give them something just for entering. Think of your promotional offer like a participation trophy \\[...0.5s\\] to make sure they redeem.Add another deadline, make claiming your promotional offer, the scholarship gift card, dollars off, store credit vouchers expire in seven days.The second countant works like the first. Show the benefits, more social proof and more viable stuff about your offer. Give them a way to book a call to claim their promotional offer. Explain the cost of value using their discount.My rule of thumb, make your core offer discount equal to 10 to 30% of your gross margins. Say we advertise a grand prize of the 5,000 dollar value and a 2,000 dollar retail price tag.Everyone else gets it for 18, a 10% discount off retail. When we let them know they qualified for something, we explain they get$5,000 value for Aiden 18 dollar price tag. By comparing the value of the thing to what they pay, a 10% discount becomes a 64% difference in cost of value.Bottom line: \\[...0.5s\\] remember, everyone that entered the giveaway showed interest in your thing, and if somebody shows interest in a thing that you have to offer, offer to them.Example: free giveaways: \\[...0.6s\\] dentist offer: free Perfect Smile Giveaway Grand prize: a free set of invisible braces 6,000 dollar retail price promotional offer: 2,000 dollar gift card for braces \\[...0.5s\\] physical products: offer: free year of organic dog food.Grand prize for your organic dog food, thousand dollar retail price, promotional offer: 300 dollar gift card for dog food, usable \\[...0.5s\\] only with a one year subscription.Services offer: \\[...0.6s\\] free ultimate giveaway Grand Prize: free one year package 5,000 dollar retail price, promotional offer: 2000 dollar voucher redeemable towards 1 year service agreement.Consulting Offer: \\[...0.6s\\] Free 16 week Turnaround Giveaway Grand Prize: \\[...0.4s\\] 16 week turnaround retail price:$12,000 \\[...0.4s\\] promotional offer$6,000 partial scholarship.Important notes. Consult legal counsel about how to structure your giveaway. I'm not legal counsel, but I do consider these no brainers because of the way that I like to do business. Somebody actually has to win the grand prize. Make the grand prize and qualifications to win clear in the rules. Make clear that more than one person can win a prize.Ask your legal counsel about the rest \\[...0.7s\\] eligibility criteria. Get more customers to buy your core offer. More people will take your core offer if you can make the value specific to them. I ask questions like this to get ammo, why should we pick you? Why this program, why now, why does this matter to you? Why is this important to you? What's your goal, etc.That being said, the more work you make it to enter, the fewer people will enter, but the more qualified they'll be. So find your sweet spot. If your giveaway doesn't work, it means your grand prize wasn't grand enough. One of my portfolio companies ran a giveaway.They barely got interest, their grand prize tickets to their event \\[...0.4s\\] not compelling. I told them grand prizes only work if they're grand. They tried it again with a 50,000 dollar bundle of equipment from a well known supplier in the gym space plus their core product for a year. And this time it crushed. Surprise.When you have an awesome thing to give away and you advertise it properly, \\[...0.4s\\] the leads flood in and giveaway kind of explains itself.So if nobody bites, then I suggest you give away something better or at least \\[...0.5s\\] better for the audience. Give away two prizes \\[...0.4s\\] for twice the leads. \\[...1.3s\\] If you give away one prize, that's fine, \\[...0.4s\\] but if you give away two grand prizes, you can get twice the leads or more.Here's how. Just tell everyone that if someone they refer wins the grand prize, they win one too. That way they get endless entries into the contest by referring their friends.This gets more people to refer and work together. This also provides a sneaky benefit. Referrers are invested in the success of their referrals. This keeps quality high.Here's the example I did for school. Com, a platform icon for people to build and monetize communities. Refer winner and you win too. Many of you are inviting friends to play the games with you, and that's the point to make business fun.To encourage this even more, we're adding a new incentive. If a person that you refer gets in the top 10, you get to come too. Aka if they win, you win.Beyond that, as a reminder, anyone you refer to school earns you a lifetime 40% commission. Everyone's gonna come to school eventually, and people can only be referred once, and since you're all early, you have a bigger opportunity to refer.So I'd encourage you to refer them before someone else does or they come on their own. Imagine referring all your friends to Facebook before everyone was on it like that, but cooler because you're actually helping them learning, grow and getting a commission too. To refer somebody to share your.For a link, go here. PS: \\[...0.4s\\] you have a higher likely to win in the games if the people you refer already have an audience to give their group an immediate boost. Scarcey, scarcey, scarcey.Limit your giveaway by time, number of entries, or both. You can run giveaways for a specific amount of time, example: 7 days, a specific number of entries, example: 5,000 entries, or both?I like both. I match how many people I let enter. I match how many people I let enter the giveaway with the number of people I have the time and resources to connect with inside 7 days. Any more would be a waste.Urgency, urgency, urgency, \\[...0.5s\\] I had urgency in three places to enter, to claim, to use. Make how long they have to enter clear in the advertisements.Once you announce the winners, let them know how long they have to claim it. When they do, schedule their call the same day or the next day if you can. Once you let people know they won, tell them how long they have to use it.I like hours, but I have gone up to 5 days in short, always have deadlines, have down sales available. Some won't or can't buy your promotional offer even with the discount or bonus, and that's okay.Here's how I approach it. At the start of the call, let them know they qualified for 2 prizes and that you'll help them figure out which way makes the most sense for them.Then present your promotional offer aka the discount on the grand price thing. If they take it great, if not, then offer the same discount by percentage on any other product you have that makes sense for them. If you have a recurring revenue business, apply their discount over the longest period of time they'll agree to.Then set up their monthly subscription to Bill automatically at normal rates after the discounted period ends. Summary points \\[...0.7s\\] at their core giveaways, ask an audience to apply to get a high value thing of yours for free. Many will enter, one wins, the rest qualify for discounts on your core offer.Pick a grand prize people want. Give two prizes away if you want more people to refer, tell them if, tell them if someone they refer wins, they win the other prize. Offer a chance to win the grand prize to anyone who enters and qualifies.You can get great information from every lead because you can make it part of the entry process. Get information that indicates how your offer will provide them value. This becomes important for making offers later.Advertise your giveaway for seven days or until the number of leads surpasses the number that you can manage to call in 7 days, whichever comes first. Book appointments with everyone else to claim your promotional offer. Use whatever reason why feels good for you.Put an expiration date on people claiming their prizes to make them more likely to claim them. If somebody says no to your core offer, have another product or service to discount. It may suit the lead better.Free gift \\[...0.4s\\] giveaways, bonus training giveaways are one of the strongest attraction offers on earth.

Which one do you think will get you the best results?June 2014, \\[...0.6s\\] John, my second mentor, retired early. He spent his retirement raising his girls, playing golf, and hanging out at his lake house.He was a man who had lived \\[...0.5s\\] once in a while. He'd invite me to his lake house, and on those long drives, he taught me things about life and business I used to this day.Like the difference between price and value, the pros and cons of low cost offers, high volume, low price business models, differences between recurring subscriptions and one time transactions, and the art of keeping things simple in business and life.John was great company, often wish we would drive forever so I could soak everything in. To him, this was just another story to pass the time, but to me, it was a lesson I would never forget.The 5 day, five dollar VIP tanning pass. You see \\[...0.5s\\] the beauty of the five dollar, five day passes. Everyone thinks they can get tan in five days, and they can, but it's never as tan as they wanna get. And if they try to speed things up, they'll burn.So when someone comes in with a pass, we ask them how tan they wanna get. And as soon as they say they wanna get a few shades darker, give them the Turkey talk.What's the Turkey talk? John smiled and continued, \\[...0.4s\\] say a Thanksgiving Turkey takes three hours to cook. We all know what happens if you double the temperature to cook it in half the time, you burn it. It takes at least five to 10 sections to get the color you want without burning.And since they got to take some time between sessions, it always takes more than five days. And once they realize that, we say, \\[...0.4s\\] let's just credit your VIP pass towards your first month. Why buy so many 25 dollar day passes when members get unlimited access for just 1999 a month? They immediately see the value and take to membership easy.As that \\[...0.7s\\] five years later, \\[...0.5s\\] hey, boss, we've got a problem, oh boy, what's up? I said \\[...0.4s\\] our fitness leads have gotten way too expensive. The guys who can sell are still making it work, but most of them are barely breaking even. Dang. So it finally happened, I said, I press my hands to my forehead. I knew this was coming.The truth is I was dreading it. I tried for weeks to put a spin on our previous offer, a new or interesting twist that advised time, but our tests failed. So far \\[...0.4s\\] you got any offers up your sleeve?You asked \\[...0.4s\\] Iraq my brain, then remember the 5 dollar VIP tanning pass that might just work. Why don't we offer something super cheap to get leads, but when they come in, make them a crazy offer that cost more but is 100 times better.They can still take the cheap thing, but what's explain that they'll get way better results with the extra accountability, nutrition, etc. Yeah, I can run something like that, he said a few weeks later. Alex, I think we cracked it. Awesome, walk me through it. So we give two options.The first option is free. I give one session per week.The second option is an ultimate version for 3\\. 99\\. It comes with unlimited sessions, one on one coaching, more personalized stuff, and a guarantee they'll get results or they repeat the burger for free.Oh man, that guarantee solid. What's the take rate? We got 70 to 80% taking the 3\\. 99 option. We're crushing it.Awesome. Let's scale it. John was a brilliant salesman and patient teacher. His philosophy of giving customers what they want now so you can give them what they would need later shaped many ways I do business. He also inspired the offer that saved my gyms.But the most valuable thing I Learned from him was this, \\[...0.6s\\] you have to know what gets results for customers better than they do.This makes our premium offer the clear solution, and making our premium the clear solution is what decoy offers are all about. Description \\[...0.6s\\] decoy offers advertise something free or discounted.Then when the lead asks to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium offer. The premium offer provides more features, benefits, bonuses, guarantees, and so on. By putting your decoy offers in premium offer side by side, leads can see how much more valuable your premium offer is.I like decoy offers because they get more customers overall. They either take the decoy version or the premium version. If they take the premium version, great.If they take the decoy also, great. It gives you time to upgrade them rather than just losing them immediately. But either way, you can close everyone. This makes it cheap and profitable, get new customers, and any business can do it.Here are the steps to make a decoy offer: \\[...0.4s\\] advertise a lesser, smaller or simpler version of your premium offer as a decoy. Then when leads engage, offer both options but emphasize the premium one. \\[...1.1s\\]Examples: \\[...0.7s\\] lemonade stand offer physical products, attraction offer free week of lemonade or \\[...0.5s\\]$1 week of lemonade.That would be the attraction offer \\[...0.5s\\] decoy option. You can have this water \\[...0.4s\\] and powdered lemon and corn syrup or \\[...0.4s\\] premium option, \\[...0.6s\\] the organic, all natural, vegan gluten free imported Italian lemons, which are cold pressed and shipped straight to your door.You'll never need to waste time coming to the store again. It'll have you feeling like a Labrador puppy chasing butterflies all day. It also comes with other flavors like our Sparkling Rose Water Lemonade Float Tank Center example service attraction offer \\[...0.4s\\] free 6 week stress release or a six dollar 6 week stress release \\[...0.5s\\] decoy option: \\[...0.9s\\] 1 float per month with at home do it yourself stress release exercises. Premium option: \\[...0.6s\\] 2 times per week floats for 6 weeks, 1.0, 1 Consulting journal sleep routine satisfaction guaranteed \\[...1.5s\\] gym offer. Local business \\[...0.5s\\] attraction offer \\[...0.5s\\] free 21 day transformation or$21 21 day transformation decoy option when they walk in the door, workouts done in a school com group once a day, a general nutrition plan \\[...0.4s\\] can watch recordings, no support, no guarantee. Premium option: \\[...0.4s\\] unlimited works outs, a personalized nutrition plan, 1\\. 0, 1 accountability results guarantee, or you get another 21 days free. \\[...1.9s\\]Important notes: \\[...0.5s\\] how to make your decoy offer: \\[...0.5s\\] offer fewer components, older models or less personalized versions of your premium offer, also remove any guarantees. Your attraction offer only has to get leads to engage, nothing more.Advertise benefits, not the features. We want to sell them on the dream outcome. We advertise a transformation in 21 days, not workouts and meal plans. Leeds get specific product details in the sales presentation, not the advertising.Private jets and rowboats can both get you to an exotic island, but the premium option is certainly more enjoyable. \\[...1.0s\\] You can advertise discounts in four ways.So let's say you have a year long thing that cost$100 a month. If you wanted to have them pay$900 for the year, you could say \\[...0.9s\\] 1\\. Percentage off, 25% off, 2\\. An absolute amount off,$300 off, \\[...0.4s\\] 3.A free portion. So 3 months free or 4 total package one year for$900, which you cross out 12 hundred dollars above it. They all mean the same thing. It's worth testing to see which one converts better in your market. Make the contrast huge.The value of the premium option comes from the huge difference between it with the decoy option. So make the decoy option as basic as reasonable, then make the premium option as awesome as possible. The bigger the contrast, the better the deal, the more customers will take it.Discount offers have higher show up rates than free offers \\[...0.4s\\] in my experience. If you run a free attraction offer, you'll get more leads. If you run a discount offer, you'll get fewer leads, but a higher percentage will show up. So if you have low show up rates for appointments, try discount offer instead.This is especially important for businesses. We have high cost of someone not showing up. Think doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc. \\[...1.1s\\] If possible, present the premium offer first. In a perfect world, they take the premium offer immediately. The decoy offer stays in your back pocket.If they come in specifically asking for the decoy option up front, then \\[...1.0s\\] get them to give you permission to sell to them. If they ask to hear about your decoy, you are legally required to present it, or if you prefer to present it first.Here's how I like to do it. I asked them the simple question, are you here for free stuff or lasting results? And as soon as they say results, which most people do, skip to your premium offer.If they say free stuff, present the decoy offer, then immediately contrast it with your premium offer. Then only after presenting both, ask them, which do you think will get you to your goal faster, or which would you prefer?The less valuable thing or why, why, why more valuable thing benefit 1, 2, 3 at this point they'll have to say the premium offer then you can move forward in the sale, mutually agreeing it's the best for them.When making your premium offer get excited about it, present it as superior to the decoy offer because it is, and assuming it is how it fits the customer better. Your excitement motivates people to take the option that will get them the best value from a selling perspective.You wanna talk to the lead as if you already know they will accept your offer. Many sales people refer to this as an assumed close, you operate from a position of, this is what everyone does, this is just a formality, let me get your ID and credit card, so you can get your value, no hype, just friendly disposition, almost bored of how regularly people buy, \\[...0.9s\\] so Prize benefit optional. To take this a step further, if someone takes the decoy option, you can choose to surprise them with a few or low to zero cost features from your premium offer.Just say something like, hey, I'm gonna throw this in even though it's part of our premium offer, just cause I want you to get great results. This builds goodwill over delivers and increases the chances they take your up cells later.Remember they're still leads \\[...0.5s\\] summary points \\[...1.3s\\] decoy offers, advertise something for your discounted, then when Leeds ask to learn more, you also present a more viable premium offer. 2.Make the premium offer far more valuable than the decoy option by adding more features, benefits, bonuses and guarantees.Strip down your decoy offer as much as reasonable. When leads ask about your decoy offer, present your premium offer right next to it. Ask are you here for free stuff or lasting results? For permission to offer the premium offer first, \\[...0.9s\\] you can still make money from Leeds who pick the decoy option.You learn the best way to deliver your decoy product and maximize the upsells from it. Expect to make money fast. And if you're not, then make the contrast between offers larger. Free gift, no often required.

Buy X get y free, \\[...0.5s\\] buy 1 puppy get 2 puppies free.Downtown, Nashville, 2020 \\[...0.7s\\] bars and shops at this popular tourist destination went in and out of business all the time, but one store Rain Supreme \\[...0.5s\\] Boot Factory. There are neon sign cut through the visual clutter of the street like a hot knife through butter.A cowboy boot bigger than my car directed me to the front door. There was no mistaking what they wanted me to do. So of course, I obeyed. And as I got closer, I could make out their offer. Buy one pair, get 2 pair free. \\[...1.1s\\]A decade passed since I've been to Nashville, but I remember the sign and buy one, get two free offer like it was yesterday.As a kid on bar crawls, I thought the offer was dumb. How could they give away so much stuff and stay in business? But now with some offer making under my belt, I could appreciate it. I went straight to the men's section and grabbed a boot, curious.The price was marked down twice to a final offer of$600 for the pair. These were normal looking boots. The young me would have scoffed, but the business me realized that I had missed something. The store got much bigger since last time I saw it, so the offer clearly worked.Then it clicked. They charged three times the price for a single pair of boots because they came with two more pairs. So rather than saying, come to Boot Factory and buy boots at a fair price, they managed to create a free offer.Even in the few minutes I checked out the store, bachelorettes filled in getting matching pairs of boots.And since the Boot Factory sat in the middle of a street full of cowboy themed bars, this happened a lot. It was brilliant \\[...1.4s\\] description in buy X get y free offers. When customers buy something, they get other stuff free. The more free stuff they get and the higher its value, the better it works.Free offers get way more attention than discount offers, but if you have one thing to sell and give it away, you go hungry.In situations like this, businesses tend to lean on discounts. They run sales relying on holidays, seasonal changes, or whatever as reasons to temporarily lower their prices and get more customers.But by selling more than one thing at once, you can turn discount offers into even stronger free offers.When you have more than one item, you can make the discount value large enough that it covers the price of the more stuff. For example, I could sell three t shirts for$10 each for a total of$30. Or I could sell one T-shirt for$30 and give away two for free.It's the same price but way more free stuff. \\[...2.6s\\] And if I wanted to offer a discount rather than only reframe the price, I could do this: I could sell three t shirts for six dollars and sixty seven cents each for a total of$20, which is a 33% discount. Or keeping the same discount, I could sell one shirt for 20 and give away two free. It's the same price but way more free stuff.Again, \\[...0.9s\\] Boot Factory took the first option. They tripled the price of one pair of boots and added value in more boots. And an expensive pair of boots with two free gets Boot Factory more customers than selling one pair at a fair price.Plus, if you can include free, then attracts even more customers. \\[...1.2s\\] Examples: \\[...0.9s\\] buy one, get 2 free physical products offer: the boot factory offer 1 pair of boots$200, buy X get y free offer: buy one for 600 dollars, get 2 pairs free.And result, they still buy 3 pairs of 200 dollar boots for total of 6 hundred dollars.Three versions \\[...0.5s\\] now here's three different versions for an 18 months of services agreement, aka three pairs of boots. Here's a good version: \\[...0.6s\\] by 12 months, get 6 months free 18 dollars. Here's a better version: by 6 months, get 6 months free 18 dollars.Here's the best version: by 6 months, get 12 months free 18 dollars. Everyone pays the same price for the same amount of service, but the third option is the most compelling. Hint. It has the most free stuff.Important notes. Buy X get y, free gets people to buy more stuff and provide more value. It used to take a whole year for some of my service businesses to make their money, \\[...0.5s\\] but buy 6, get 6 \\[...0.5s\\] offer attracted far more customers than the original month, month offer. Even better, they got paid up front for it. \\[...1.1s\\]Raise prices before giving away free stuff to preserve profits. If you use this to attract customers, it will work, and since it will work, you need to make money.So permanently raise prices to accommodate the discount. Don't lie, actually raise your prices since this is what all new customers will be coming in on. Then it makes sense to change it for a season at least. Plus, plenty of people might still take \\[...0.4s\\] your double prices a LA carte and break your limiting beliefs around prices.You're welcome. Buy X get y free works better if you have more free stuff than paid stuff. For example, \\[...0.5s\\] buy 10, get 2 free is not as strong as buy 2, get 10 free.This seems obvious, but again, people don't do it to make it work. Better, give more free stuff than you ask people to buy. Just play with the pricing until it makes sense for you. Buy one, get two instead of buy 2, get one. The free things can be different from the paid things.When people first start doing offers like this, they match the free and paid stuff, but you can mix and match whatever you want. Just make sure the value of different free stuff still makes the offer compelling.Example: \\[...0.6s\\] let's say \\[...0.4s\\] socks have a 10 dollar value. If they buy one shirt for 10 dollars but get 20 dollars free socks, it may seem like a better deal. \\[...1.3s\\] More cheaper things can work better than fewer free expensive things.Revisiting the T-shirt example, \\[...0.7s\\] let's say I could only afford to give away one shirt for free, but for the same cost, I could give them 3 pairs of socks. I probably test \\[...0.4s\\] buy one shirt, get one shirt free against buy one shirt, get 3 pairs of socks for free.Socks cost less than a shirt, but people still see buy one thing, get 3 things free. Sometimes more cheaper things works better than fewer expensive things.Rather than offer a 33% discount, try buy one, get 2 free. Even though it can be structured to accomplish the same thing, free drives more interest than a discount. More people know the value free than the value of one shirt.For example, rather than selling 10 dollar shirts for six dollars and sixty seven cents each, 33% off, you may get more interest and make more money \\[...0.5s\\] by offering buy one shirt for$20, get two free.Just test it. Do not make offers like this if you can't manage money. While buy X get y free offers create massive cashload for a business you need to deliver. So if you get a whole year's worth of payments in a month, make sure you can deliver for the whole year.Budget the correct amount of money to service your customers for the duration of your agreement. Don't be a goon and buy yourself a house with the cash meant for servicing your customers. Selling stuff you can't deliver on breaks the law and ruins your reputation.Deliver on your promises. \\[...1.6s\\] Make this offer to existing customers for fast cash. If you have a recurring business already and need fast cash, you can make this offer to existing customers. Many will happily buy 10 and get two free at their current price. Just cap how many can take the offer to 10% of your customer base. This gives you a good cash pop and keeps recurring cash flow healthy. Even if customers prepay, then \\[...0.4s\\] you can still upsell them different stuff.Now \\[...0.7s\\] a lot of people don't want to make more offers to customers who prepay for stuff.This is a mistake speaking from experience. These are the people who spend the most money. Give them other offers to buy, and they will. After all, \\[...0.6s\\] they may have prepaid months ago. Their wallets have been refreshed with new money that is dying to make it in your pocket.Don't get in the way. \\[...1.1s\\] If customers only buy once, make the buy as big as you can.The boot factory in my store catered to tourists that wanna fit in at the local cowboy bars. This means most of their customers made one purchase ever. For that reason, it makes sense to make that purchase as large as possible. Just provide the value to back it up.If you only have one shot, you might as well make it count \\[...1.7s\\] summary points \\[...0.5s\\] in buy X get y free offers, when customers buy something, they get other stuff free. Buy X get y free works for stuff that makes sense to buy more of or get longer access to.Basic buy X get y free offers reframe pricing. Buy 1 gets 2 free costs the same as buying 3, except customers see the free offer is more valuable. \\[...1.0s\\] Just look at the 18 months of service example.Always try to give more free things than paid things. You compare different free things with your paid things. Some buy X get why free offers discount the price or buying more things cost less per thing than buying the same number of things one at a time. \\[...1.3s\\]By X get y free can lengthen the amount of time customers stay. If normal customers stay for 3 months, then by 2 get 2 free will keep them for 4 months or whatever you set it at. This gives you more opportunities to make more offers and provide more value. \\[...1.6s\\]If you use Buy X get y free to generate lots of cash fast, make sure you manage it well and deliver on your promises. If you need fast cash, you can make this offer to existing recurring customers.Just cap how many you sell to so you still have cash flow. Keep selling customers who prepay long durations, they are the most likely customers to buy again.

The registration page said, you can put your credit card down for$0 and get Bill \\[...0.5s\\]$297 tomorrow, and if your reading speed doesn't double, just email us before then and we'll cancel the charge. But you must attend in order to be eligible.Or \\[...0.4s\\] you can just pay$97 right now and as a free bonus get the recordings, which won't be for sale anywhere else. \\[...1.3s\\]I decided on the first option. I wanted to see if my reading speed doubled before paying anything, \\[...0.4s\\] the whole training. I expect him to sell me more stuff, but he simply provided value. After 2 hours using his tactics, my reading speed doubled. Impressive. The training had been true to the promise. He earned his$297.After that, he talked about how I could learn to read even faster with his eight week training program.I was satisfied with my results, so I chose not to take the up. So \\[...0.4s\\] he taught me a skill I still use to this day. The true value came from learning a brand new attraction offer \\[...0.6s\\] description \\[...0.6s\\] in pay less now or pay more later. You give people a choice to pay full price later or pay a discounted price now.This play works so well because remove all risk from the customer. They pay later and only if they like it. So combined the benefits of a delayed payment and a satisfaction guaranteed, anyone can sell this.Almost anyone will agree to pay later if they're satisfied. But once they agree to pay later, you can get them to pay now with hefty discounts and valuable bonuses.Pay later option allows you to advertise free since they can choose to pay or not. This gets lots of engage leads, but this free offer has an added benefit, we get their card on file. So if they choose this option and hate the product, then they can cancel it any time before the charge goes through.If they accept the pay later option, we make a follow up offer to pay now, and pay now options provide a 20 to 50% discount and greater bonuses, and since we already have their card on file, make it easier for them to pay.Whether they choose to pay now or pay later, you've got customers and likely some profit. But to take a full advantage of this offer, you want something else to sell, so have something more better or newer to offer when the time is right. And don't worry, we'll go deep on up sales in the next section. \\[...1.1s\\]Examples: \\[...0.8s\\] find your first real estate deal free 3 day workshop \\[...0.5s\\] pay later option: \\[...0.8s\\]$0 for 3 day workshop, get build$500 at the end unless you cancel pay now option \\[...1.2s\\] 2.99 \\[...0.4s\\] for 3 day workshop plus recordings 1:01 call with certified distress property expert plus printing materials to use delivered at the workshop.Upsell offer \\[...1.0s\\] from the Workshop \\[...0.8s\\]$30,000 take you through every other step of closing your first deal within six months, plus legal templates, advisative at the investment inspection checklist, etc. Local Business Service, \\[...0.7s\\] trim your hedges for free, pay later.

If you don't, they will ask not to be built duh. For example, if you promise to decrease someone shoulder pain, have them rate their pain 1 to 10 before you do your magic, then ask them to rate it after.If it went down, you've succeeded, and you can tell them something else. Keep the promise simple, clear and measurable. This avoids unnecessary cancellations.Make a conditional satisfaction guarantee. People can only cancel the billing if they qualify. For example, I had to show up to the reading training to qualify to cancel the charge. After all, they can't say that you suck if they never tried it. So be sure to track the conditions necessary to qualify. Think attendance, showing up to an appointment, turning in data, etc.Make the criteria what people do to get the most value of the product.

If too many people take your pay now option, do the opposite.If more than 10% of pay later people cancel their payment, you promise too much, the guarantee conditions are too low, or the price is too high.Note, no matter how well you deliver, some people will cancel the payment, and that's okay, factored into your cost of doing business and keep living your life.This works for occurring revenue businesses too. You just give them the option to pay a higher ongoing rate 30 days later, or they pay less today, and keep the lower rate for good, plus add in some bonuses.

By accident, I applied everyone bought supplements without offering them.And all the head nods I got showed that they actually did want more products. And all these factors got more people to buy when I did offer to them.Summary points, \\[...1.1s\\] pay less now or pay more later. Offers give people a choice to pay full price later or pay discounter price with additional bonuses if they pay now.The pay later option has a delayed payment with a conditional guarantee. Have clear criteria to qualify for the guarantee and easy ways to measure it if you can align the criteria with what gets people the most value from the product.The pay now option offers 20 to 50% discount and bonuses if they pay now. Offer customers to pay now option after they accept the pay later option.

Your review helps one more small business like bills provide for their community.In Bill's own words, \\[...0.7s\\] I opened a pizzeria in early 2020 shortly after finding the 100 million offers book.Sales started slow, but we did it \\[...0.7s\\] after I read 100 million dollar leads. We implemented many things like having customers donate to the local food bank for a chance to win free prizes. For a year, \\[...0.4s\\] I've lost count of how many new customers we've gotten after doing these things for the community. This absolutely proves the stuff works for any type of business.

I'm just normal guy from Germany and I couldn't get a client to save my life.Then I bought a hundred million dollar leads. After reading the Cold Hour Reach chapter, I started the rule of 100\\. I expected maybe to get one to two clients, but then I booked eight meetings in seven days. I closed four of them and earned my first$500 from one of those clients. It has been three months now, and my career couldn't be better.Your book was the only book I needed. I recommend it to everyone, and your review could help one more entrepreneur like Alex get out of a hole. In Alex's own words, I moved in with my girlfriend making less than a thousand dollars a month. I bought 100 Mile leads and we applied everything.Three weeks later, we signed a client for$2,000 a month, then three more. I owe you a lot more than what these books cost. Your review helps one more entrepreneur like Mohan flee his country and get out of debt.In Mohan's own words, \\[...0.4s\\] as a struggling Indian immigrant trying to get to Ireland, I made so little money I would die before I pay off my debt. I tutored on the side where I could, then I read 100 million dollar offers and quit my job.11 days later, \\[...0.4s\\] I did the same work but Learned how to make offers. This time clients were happy to pay, sometimes even 15 dollars when I gave some bonuses. I make a livable income now, \\[...0.4s\\] and I finally found what I love to do.

Attraction conclusion \\[...0.4s\\] extra, extra, hear all about it. The point of attraction offers is to turn strangers into customers and do it in a way that gets more cash up front.Ideally, we get enough cash to cover the cost of the customer and the cost to deliver our thing multiple times.Over \\[...0.9s\\] that way, we can pay ourselves back and get our next customer. I showed you the 5 most powerful attraction offers I've seen and used when your money back giveaways, decoy offers, Bix get y free and pay less now or pay more later. I play them one time or another to every business I own.They turned$1,000 into 10 million in 10 months, because when I got returns, I kept doubling down.A Grand Slam attraction offer changes your business and life forever. After using attraction offers, we've got more customers, \\[...0.7s\\] and now that we've got them, we need to boost our 30 day profits even more by selling them even more stuff.This leads us to the next component of a hundred million dollar money model upsell offers. What to offer next \\[...0.6s\\] section 3 upsell offers. Do you want fries with that \\[...0.4s\\] McDonald's famous upsell? With an attraction offer in place, you've got customers and cash.If we did a good job, we've turned our profit to \\[...0.4s\\] nice. Now we want to maximize 30 day profits, so what do we do? Answer make more money to do that, we make up sale offers. And when it comes down to it, up sales just means whatever we offer next.How up sales work? \\[...1.2s\\] When an offer solves a problem, another appears, you upsell the solution the problem your offer reveals. So every offer opens the door to an upsell, even upsells. Often upsells make the majority of the profit they make or break a bunny model. Let me show you how.Much. Let's say a burger shop makes 25 cents in profit on a two dollar burger. If it was the only offer they had, they'd have to sell 10,000 burgers a day to cover costs and barely eat out a living.Good luck. But they have more offers beyond just the burger. They ask, do you want fries with that? If the person says yes, they profit another 75 cents. And then ask, \\[...0.5s\\] do you wanna make a meal? Which adds a drink?If someone says yes, they profit an extra \\[...0.4s\\]$1 75\\. Their profit goes from ￠25 to$2 and 8 x increase and on top of that they offer a third up sale do you wanna supersize your meal for just a buck more this takes profit from a measly ￠25 to a massive$3 and 11.6 x increase and now this little burger place actually has a chance of succeeding \\[...1.5s\\] I show this basic and common example to point one thing your first offer doesn't always have to make a profit \\[...0.8s\\] in other words the thing you sell the most isn't always the thing you make the most profit on \\[...0.7s\\] you make it on the second third and in the case the burger business fourth offers and beyond \\[...0.5s\\] if McDonald's didn't upsell fries and soda there wouldn't be a McDonald's if you wanna win you have to figure out your version of do you want fries with that if you don't others will up cells fail when you offer something they don't want two different or doesn't solve their problem you offer at the wrong time before they've experienced the problem you offer at the wrong way they don't believe you or combination of all three \\[...0.6s\\] in summary offers tend to offer more of what they just got think quantity why have one burger when you could have two \\[...0.4s\\] better versions of it than quality why have mystery meat when you could have sirloin \\[...0.4s\\] new or complimentary stuff think different do you want fries in a soda with that \\[...0.6s\\] I use 4 simple and brutally effective upsell offers the classic upsell menu upsells anchor up cells and rollover upsells \\[...0.4s\\] and with just a few tweaks you can fit them into your business today warning \\[...0.4s\\] this section is brutally effective and must be used ethically that being said let's make some money \\[...1.3s\\] free gift \\[...0.5s\\] up so offers no option if you wanna make more profit per customer you gotta sell more stuff knowing the right time way and stuff to sell is key I've Learned my fair sheriff lessons doing it the wrong way I hope I can help you avoid those mistakes and get it done right the first time \\[...0.5s\\] I made you an additional training on this chapter you can watch for free at acquisition.com for slash training for slash money \\[...0.6s\\] the classic up sell you can't have X without y \\[...1.7s\\] he was a premier fur coat dealer a fourth generation business savant and a childhood mentor of mine we sat down to catch up in a swanky restaurant across from a shop \\[...0.5s\\] within a minute of ordering our salmon appeared \\[...0.7s\\] what do you think the salmon cost the restaurant three bucks \\[...0.4s\\] maybe a few extra pennies for the garnish look at the menu they're charging 32 bucks unbelievable but we pay it he took his first bite and chuckled to himself then continued \\[...0.4s\\] so I heard you got into the game good for you never would have guessed when you worked at the shop you were kind of awkward \\[...1.1s\\] what can I say rushing 7,004 coats in a row melted my brain I chuckled \\[...0.6s\\] you still making a killing on that \\[...0.5s\\] sheepish grin appeared yeah and that's not even the best part my son came up with something genius his son would be the fifth generation owner \\[...0.5s\\] tell me about it I asked \\[...0.5s\\] we advertise free earmuffs with coat storage and get this when customers come in to get their muffs and store their coats he says \\[...0.5s\\] great and we'll store those as well for$30 you don't wanna store anything else do you \\[...0.4s\\] and of course they say no wait a second so you get them to pay for additional storage for free earmuffs by getting them to say no to another upsell \\[...0.5s\\] you guys are legends \\[...0.4s\\] us no you stay creative and if something works we stick with it \\[...0.7s\\] whenever you talk business he'd light up despite being awkward around a shop I Learned many lifelong lessons from him I share the story and homage those lessons description the classic upsell offers a solution to the customers next problem the moment they become aware of it I explain the classic upsell first because it's extremely profitable easy and anyone can do it \\[...0.4s\\] main reason current customers always have a higher chance of buying your stuff than strangers and when timed right customers upsolve themselves \\[...0.9s\\] the classic UPS overlies on knowing more about your customers problem than they do and you darn well should it's your business after all \\[...0.7s\\] the idea is simple your core offer solves one problem and creates another your off cell immediately solves that next problem this gives the classic upset it's you can't have X without y structure \\[...0.6s\\] like the rental car story can't have a car without insurance can't have car without gas can't have a good trip without a late checkout \\[...0.5s\\] etc all these things become immediately parent as soon as the customer makes the first purchase bottom line if a problem appears and you can solve it immediately in exchange for money \\[...0.4s\\] do it \\[...1.5s\\] examples \\[...0.8s\\] local car wash service first purchase car wash up sell sealant you're not gonna do the car wash without sealant you'll get way more for your money \\[...0.8s\\] physical product first purchase bicycle up sell 1 helmet up sell 2 lights up sell 3 puncture resistant tires can't have a bike without a helmet \\[...1.3s\\] digital product first purchase course and exercising Upsell Nutrition course \\[...0.4s\\] you cannot exercise a bad diet so you're gonna want to course in nutrition \\[...1.3s\\] important notes \\[...0.7s\\] actually do it you'd be amazed how many businesses come to me and only sell one thing I usually tell them you barely have a business you have a front it figure out what you're gonna sell next \\[...0.5s\\] months later \\[...0.7s\\] I hear they actually 5 x their business because they actually offered an upsell \\[...1.2s\\] offer more profitable upsells first if I offer two products and one has a higher profit than the other I offer the higher profit option first get them to say no to say yes I was always amazed at how often the fur coat dealer got people to buy stuff by saying no he knew people had been trained to say no in response to you don't want anything else do you but this actually turns a no into a yes \\[...0.5s\\] so when upselling the question translate to you don't want anything else besides what I just offered do you \\[...0.4s\\] clever salesmanship \\[...0.5s\\] so let the nos \\[...0.8s\\] parentheses yeses roll in \\[...1.5s\\] surprise and delight \\[...0.5s\\] let's say you have four bonuses you save to get people to buy who are on the fence \\[...0.4s\\] add one at a time if they say yes before you add them still give them all four \\[...0.4s\\] it will surprise and delight them and it guarantees you still sell the same thing to everyone so no one feels left out later sell more when they're buying more hyper buying cycle \\[...0.6s\\] most buyers enter a hyper buying cycle when they decide to do something new it's a short window a time when they're most excited about a new thing they're gonna do this is when they spend a huge chunk of money in a short period of time think weddings starting new hobbies having babies moving to new places and so on if you have a business that caters these sort of problems don't shy away from upsell offers embrace it and keep making offers \\[...0.8s\\] use free bonuses to create problems upsell offer solve \\[...0.5s\\] bonuses solve problems that's what makes them valuable and because of the problem solution cycle they can also reveal them \\[...0.7s\\] up sales can solve that new problem the earmuffs for example cost materials in labor \\[...0.4s\\] but they were able to give them away for free by getting customers to pay$30 to store something they just got for free \\[...0.5s\\] the faster people get access to stuff the more they value it \\[...0.8s\\] a 10,000 dollar thing you get later is worth less than a 10,000 dollar thing you get now the longer it takes someone to access something the less value it has in the moment so if you wanna raise the chance of someone taking an upsell make it available as soon as you can bonus points if you can put it in their hands before they've said yes it's way harder to give something back once you've gotten it \\[...2.9s\\] if you bundle up sales name them it's easier to sell someone one thing than nine things by bundling items together you can make one ask and get nine sales I name the packages based on the customer type and or result for example fastest results bundle or transformation package or minimum package all these will boost upsells per person last you can peel some of the products or features from the packages away to downsell \\[...0.4s\\] more than that in section 5 Downsell offers \\[...0.9s\\] integrate upsales into your other offers \\[...0.7s\\] mixed if you upsell part of how you deliver other offers then more customers will take them my meal plans included optional supplement suggestions \\[...1.4s\\] people asked about supplements gym launch sales and marketing training suggested optional softwares this LED gym owners to buy them integrate the next thing you wanna sell into the first thing they buy \\[...0.5s\\] make sure you book a meeting from a meeting Bam fam \\[...0.9s\\] the more times you can upsell the more people you will upsell \\[...1.2s\\] if you upsell more people you can make more money \\[...0.5s\\] since you want that end every appointment by scheduling the next appointment \\[...0.4s\\] don't let them leave without booking as my big fancy public CEO Frenchron says \\[...0.7s\\] any customer should know the next time they see you and why before they leave so if you agree to meet again agree on why and when right then \\[...0.8s\\] up sale as many times as it makes sense to \\[...0.4s\\] the rental car agency had lots of up cells their burger place had lots of up cells my gym had lots of up cells \\[...0.5s\\] gym launch had lots of up cells offer many solutions as there are problems that you can solve don't be shy if you can solve it offer to the second worst thing that happens is they say no the worst thing is if they would have said yes but you never asked \\[...0.7s\\] the magnetic metal \\[...1.0s\\] Pro tip how to offer more of the same thing \\[...0.4s\\] if you have two things and want to sell one add a third option to nudge the option you want them to buy \\[...0.4s\\] movie theaters do this all the time with soda and popcorn here's how \\[...0.6s\\] they're small \\[...0.4s\\] medium and large pricing work something like this \\[...0.6s\\] small$5 medium$8 \\[...0.4s\\] rather than the rational price of 7 which would be in between \\[...0.4s\\] and then c \\[...0.5s\\] large$9 \\[...0.6s\\] result \\[...0.6s\\] more people take the large \\[...0.4s\\] people who take the small option will always take the small option people take the large will always take the large but the people who would normally take the medium will now probably take the large \\[...0.5s\\] if you wanna get more people to buy the medium option you'd price it like this small would be$6 rather than the rational price of$5 the medium is 7 halfway in between the original pricing and then large is$9 \\[...0.8s\\] this upsells more people into the medium option because now most people would normally get a small will get a medium bottom line if you have a lot of customers buying small you can bump them into mediums if you have a lot of customers buying medium bump them to large if you have a lot of customers buying large raise all your prices \\[...0.8s\\] upsell guarantees warranties and insurance \\[...0.5s\\] many businesses offer guarantees on products many businesses offer warranties on products many businesses offer insurance on products you can upsell all of them so instead of doing it for free just add 5 to 50% onto the price in exchange for a guarantee that the thing does what you say well example in art studio used to replace damage portraits at no charge I told them to start asking for customers if they pay an extra 10% for it now 30% of customers buy stuff the art studio used to give away for free pure profit \\[...0.8s\\] summary \\[...0.7s\\] your attraction offer reveals a problem up cells whatever you offer next solve it \\[...0.6s\\] use the classic up cell for immediate problems revealed by your previous offer \\[...0.5s\\] asking you don't want anything else do you \\[...0.6s\\] gets people to agree by saying no it works \\[...0.6s\\] increase the chance customers take up sells by giving them access to it as soon as possible give way bonuses that create an up sell opportunity a great way to make more cash to get more chances to up sell customers make Bam fam a way of life book a meeting from a meeting \\[...0.7s\\] you can have as many upsell offers as you want as long as you keep solving problems you lose nothing by offering to solve someone's problem if it makes sense for your business you can charge for guarantees warranties or insurance rather than giving them away for free \\[...0.7s\\] free gift \\[...0.7s\\] watch the Classic Upsell video training no opting required the first upsell everyone should learn is the classic upsell there are a bunch of tiny tips that can make a big difference I made a training video to make sure that you didn't miss any of these tiny details you can watch for free at acquis com for slash training for slash money menu upsells you don't need that you need this \\[...0.6s\\] December 2013 \\[...0.8s\\] people kept joining the gym like normal but nobody cared about my supplements \\[...0.4s\\] I read somewhere keeping shelves full got more people to buy so I stock my shelves with all the labels in a perfect row it didn't work I also heard if I told someone about the cool science they would buy that didn't work either I got a few pity purchases from loyal members but I was doing something seriously wrong why do I suck so much \\[...0.6s\\] on a particularly rough day I had 19 nutrition consults and nobody bought anything it was miserable \\[...0.5s\\] then appointment No 20 came in she had a nice purse and a big diamond ring on her hand if I can't sell her I should just quit trying but then I remembered I've got$5,000 inventory in my shelf I gotta figure this out \\[...0.6s\\] we went through her nutrition consultation and I started getting nervous I got so nervous I forgot my script and rather than gabbing about science stuff I just says \\[...0.5s\\] you've got a protein shake for breakfast do you like chocolate or vanilla \\[...0.4s\\] which one's your favorite she asked \\[...0.4s\\] uh chocolate \\[...0.6s\\] great I'll take one of those wait what just happened I didn't talk about the benefits or anything I just asked what you wanted and she told me taking the hint I moved on to the next item \\[...0.5s\\] do you want Kiwi or strawberry lemonade pre workout then I remembered her last question \\[...0.4s\\] I like strawberry lemonade smiling great I'll take that one I had more products but selling two was a record and I didn't want to scare her away I still had to ask for money \\[...0.4s\\] so I grabbed her membership contract that already had her card on it and I asked do you want to choose the cards that we have on file \\[...0.6s\\] yep that's fine \\[...0.4s\\] after that conversation I sold the next 20 customers in a row at the end of the day I stared at my empty shelf in this belief I know how to sell supplements \\[...0.6s\\] take away \\[...0.4s\\] I stumbled on two tactics that change my upsell game forever first the AB upsell I ask which product they prefer \\[...0.7s\\] rather than whether they want to buy a product at all second asking if they want to use a card on file rather than ask them to take out their cardigan I still use both to this day \\[...0.6s\\] August 2014 \\[...0.5s\\] now I close sales left and right Bing bang boom now it wasn't exactly big stuff but I was selling consistently every month I start a new group of challengers and light clockwork at Upsell five grand to 10 grand of supplements not bad for a day's work but on one day I had a lady who just wouldn't stop asking questions she wanted more information how to take them how many when what times what if she was working what if she was at home what if she was at the gym she was relentless I was gonna be late for my next consult so finally I just wrote up a step by step instruction on the back of scratch paper take one of these at night take two of these after lunch take one of these after workout yada yada yada \\[...0.6s\\] I walked through what I wrote and asked make sense nodding thanks she grabbed the paper and left \\[...0.6s\\] the next appointment it overheard our entire conversation as soon as she sat down she asked do you think you could write it all out like you did for that lady I tried not to let out a sigh I failed \\[...0.4s\\] I was gonna be late for my next consult again \\[...0.4s\\] but \\[...0.5s\\] I did as she asked this time I wrote instructions right on the order form next to each item I wrote how much to take and when because I didn't wanna push my points back another 15 minutes I just went for the up so \\[...0.7s\\] I got all your instructions here do you want to use the card on file last yeah that's fine hot diggity dog she's bought all those products I don't even ask her anything I just told her \\[...0.4s\\] and she did and she did it \\[...0.4s\\] like magic I did this from that day forward and my 30 day profit skyrocketed takeaway \\[...0.4s\\] I Learned detailed and personalized instructions upsell more people than vague in general instructions I call this prescription upselling November 2016 \\[...0.8s\\] by now I was on the road launching other people's gyms and that included selling supplements I sold thousands of people I'd see 40 to 50 people a day two people every 30 minutes 12 hours straight my supplement selling marathons alone covered the flight there my hotel and advertising costs I got so good I run out of stuff to sell today was one of those days \\[...0.5s\\] I just sold a lady the last four of different products in situations like this I saw whatever I had left to the next customer but before I could pitch she blurted out can I just get what she got oh boy I said sorry I just ran out but honestly you can get something close \\[...0.6s\\] at the shop down the street for about 20 bucks less it's not as good but it'll do for the first month cool thank you so much for helping me out she seems so grateful it felt good \\[...0.4s\\] so I continued on selling oh this other thing same story again not as good but it'll get you through the first month she seems so happy I couldn't stop myself though I started unselling stuff I wasn't gonna sell her anyways you're not trying to gain weight right I joked oh God no okay great well then you won't be needing this either I crossed out with the weight gainer shake oh \\[...0.9s\\] and you aren't gonna need to boost your testosterone right no haha I don't think so she said \\[...0.4s\\] great well you won't be needing this either I crossed it out then I started making suggestions from what I had left okay so you need to take two of these three of these and I went on she loved it and bought without hesitation take away \\[...0.8s\\] I went out of my way to cross out what she didn't need and this built enough goodwill to upsell what she did \\[...0.5s\\] later I kept products just to cross them out I called this process unselling \\[...0.8s\\] description \\[...0.4s\\] in a menu upsell you tell customers which options they don't need then tell them what they do need their preferences and how they get value from it menu upsells combine up to four tactics a B upselling prescription upselling unselling and carbon file first I inso what customers don't need second I prescribe what they do need third I ask their preference between a and B \\[...0.4s\\] last I make the buying easy by asking if they want to use the card on file \\[...0.5s\\] unselling \\[...0.7s\\] you unsell them by telling customers what they don't need so they can emphasize what they do here instead of asking if they wanna buy or not you explain what they don't need as a way to get them excited about what they do unsells vary based on the customers needs \\[...0.4s\\] when some options work best you can cross out the rest \\[...0.4s\\] after telling them what they don't need prescription up so \\[...1.0s\\] we tell them what they do need prescription up cells work well when offering a choice is inconvenient and you only have one thing that solves the problem prescription upselling has two important components \\[...0.4s\\] first you have to explain how it integrates with the offers they already bought \\[...0.4s\\] second you personalize in detail how to maximize its value here instead of asking if they want to buy it or not you explain how to use it as if they already have again you remove the option of not buying to lower the chance that they don't buy and once I've told them exactly how they're gonna use everything AB up cell \\[...0.4s\\] we ask them for their preferences AB up cells work for multiple offers that solve the same problem you make AB upsells by asking their preference instead of asking if customers want to buy a product yes or no we ask which product they prefer a or B \\[...0.6s\\] either choice results in an upsell basically when you give people the option not to buy some don't buy so I give the option to pick between buying two similar things once they know what they're buying and how they're gonna use it I suggest the easiest way for them to pay card on file \\[...0.6s\\] a chair on top of all this upsell goodness I literally ask do you wanna use the card you have on file \\[...0.6s\\] here instead of asking if they want to pay or not you refer to ways they already have this gets more people to buy because it lowers the hidden costs of buying picking which card to use taking it out being reminded of the ugly buying decisions in the past even the hassle buying stuff in a rush and who knows how many more just know if you make it easy for people to buy more people will \\[...0.4s\\] this took me 10 years to learn \\[...0.4s\\] may you get the same value in 10 minutes \\[...0.6s\\] examples massage therapist unsell we have a lymphatic massage available but you're not pregnant we're just out of surgery right so we can cross that out \\[...0.5s\\] prescribe \\[...0.4s\\] since your shoulder hurts we'll heat you up first then hit your trigger points and after that we'll do some dynamic stretches AB \\[...0.5s\\] so would you rather do it before work or on your way home card on file when I just use the card on file \\[...1.7s\\] dog food \\[...0.5s\\] unsell \\[...0.4s\\] you're not gonna need this small bag or this puppy stuff you've got a big dog you don't need these vitamins either cause we've got that in the food already \\[...0.5s\\] prescribe \\[...0.6s\\] you're also gonna wanna give your dog one of these joint chews \\[...0.1s\\]Each meal and every 90 days, give them one of these wafers for heartworms. Also make sure you bring them back next month. Let's get that book now. AB, so does your dog prefer beef or chicken flavor?

If you sold out of it, take payment and delay delivery.Later I Learned I could just sell stuff, order it, \\[...0.6s\\] and then set the expectation of when it will arrive. This allowed me to sell way more selection because I didn't have to carry inventory. If you run out, consider collecting the cash and changing the delivery expectation.You'd be surprised how all this works. Employees love unselling employees often, like helping customers game the system. Let them \\[...0.7s\\] encourage customers to help customers gain the system on purpose.Your employees have inside or outs, so allow them to show customers how to get the most value out of what you have to offer. Everyone wins. \\[...1.2s\\]Pro tip, the economist. Play \\[...0.7s\\] if you have two options and want people to buy both. In the late 1990s, the economist magazine started offering a digital subscription because more people got their news online, but it also wanted to keep its profitable print subscription.So thinking people would buy both, the economist offered the following: a digital subscription for$59 a year, a digital plus print subscription for one 25 a year.Result: print sales plummeted as customers flocked the cheaper option. Oops, \\[...0.7s\\] to fix it, they added a decoy option for the same price as the bundle. So option A, \\[...0.5s\\] digital subscription$59 a year. Option B, print subscription only \\[...0.4s\\] one 25 a year, C \\[...0.5s\\] Digital plus print subscription also 1\\. 25 a year. Result: customers now took C \\[...0.4s\\] digital plus print subscription \\[...0.4s\\] for 1.25 a year. Bottom line present three options, option A, option B, option C, which is both, but you make the price of C the same as the more expensive option B so as long as you price the options to preserve your margins, you make the customer's choice easy and sell both.Summary points: menu upsells work best when you have multiple offers available. Menu upsells combine up to four tactics. Unselling, you tell customers what they don't need, prescribing you tell them what they do need.

But now I had Gym Lodge, and a fashionable friend said I should look professional.Businessmen don't wear tank tops. Alex, \\[...0.4s\\] I know the owner of a local shoe shop. I'll tell him you're coming. I took his advice and went. So I budgeted$500 for suit, which was a big purchase for me at the time. I walked into the suit shop and made small talk. He knew I was coming.Wow, I told him I just started a new business and wanted a boss suit. He took my measurements and grabbed two suits off the rack.I put the first one on. How does it look? How does it feel? Yes, \\[...0.7s\\] I smiled. I felt cool. Like a rich guy. It was nice. He talked about some accessories, but I didn't listen much. I was too cool to listen. Now, huh, \\[...0.5s\\] this is gonna be awesome. You turn to talk to an employee. I flip the price tag over so I could see it$16,000.My face turned red. All I could think of was my friend who asked the owner to make time for me. And I couldn't even afford anything here. I felt horrible. I kept my head down, trying to hide my shock. I took a deep breath and looked up. I failed. He had seen me.Blush \\[...0.9s\\] coming to my aid, he asked, do you care about the designer much? Not at all. Almost. Before I finish replying, the owner rolled around and draped the next suit over my shoulder. Try this one on for size, he said.I look to the mirror. Looks good. Then I look down at the price tag. Twenty two hundred dollars. It wasn't 500, but it wasn't 16 grand either. Sigh relief. Yeah, this works. I'll take this one. He winked and nodded. You got it, boss. \\[...1.2s\\]The owner sold me some socks, a handkerchief, and a shirt to go with it, all in another 300 dollars. But after seeing the 16 thousand dollar price tag on the fursuit, everything seemed cheap.Looking back, this wasn't the owner's first Rodeo. He was a real pro. I spent five times more than I'd budget it and I thought, okay about it. I only later realized he used a price anchor \\[...0.7s\\] description. With anchor up sales, you offer premium stuff first. If the customer gasps, you offer a cheaper but acceptable alternative. Basically, if you present your main offer, some people will buy it.Duh. But if you present a premium version that's five to 10 times the price first, lots of people will say no. Then when you present your main offer, it looks like a much better deal, so more people will buy it.Aha, that's the power of anchor up cells. Anchor upsells work best when lower price offer has the same core function as the premium one.For instance, I didn't care about the designer that much. I just needed a suit. So compared to the 16 thousand dollar suit, the 22 dollar suit was a way better deal. Anchor up sales also have two amazing bonuses.First, anchored customers spend more than they normally would.Second, some customers will still buy the super expensive thing. Here are the steps: \\[...0.7s\\] 1\\. Present the anchor the really expensive thing. 2\\. Get the gasp. Expect the customer to freak out about the cost. 3\\. Come to the rescue. Ask if they care what makes it premium. 4.Present your main offer. Expect the customer feel relieved and see the better deal. Step 5: ask how they wanna pay. Which car would you prefer?Pro tip, \\[...0.6s\\] the only thing worse than making a thousand dollar offer to a person with a hundred dollar budget is making a hundred dollar offer to someone with a thousand dollar budget.In the first situation, you lose$100, in the second you lose 900\\. I've lost tons of customers and mounds of cash because customers wanted more than I'd offer. Boo. So now I always have premium upsells ready. Only a handful of customers buy them, but that handful of customers bring in big profits.So always have premium offers even if most people don't buy. Remember, you won't lose customers by offering premium stuff first. You will lose money if you don't. Examples: local service, lawn care \\[...0.4s\\] Premium Maker: get my cellphone number.Fancy Mulch: Natural Pest Control Bi Weekly Yard Maintenance, thousand dollars a Week. Main Offer: get my team's number.Generic Mulch: Normal Pest Control Bi Weekly Yard Maintenance$200 a week.

Main offer: \\[...0.4s\\] new issues only, plus on time$19 a month. Important notes: if you treat the anchor like a fake, so will the customer.Some people hear about this technique, try it, gloss over the premium payment and then say that it doesn't work.If you do that, then the person never really considered it because you never really offered it, you just went through the motions for this to work, you need to actually sell it, and they have to actually consider it only after they pause, hesitate or ask for something else.Do you move on to the next thing? Make a premium offer you actually want people to buy.A friend of mine struggle to get this working. I only had to listen to one call to figure out the problem. He made up some BS that he didn't really want them to buy, so we tweaked the offer, something he would actually feel happy to deliver if someone paid, and they did \\[...0.4s\\] tripling his profits.Actually present your premium offer, like, you want people to take it, and when you do some will, and if they don't, you still anchor them. A proper anchor gets the gasp \\[...0.5s\\] when due and anchor up sell correctly, customers will have a mini panic attack.I call this the gasp. Gasps used to really stress me out when I was selling, but then I realized something cute. The bigger the gasp, the more they bought. Once you get the gasp, come to the rescue. In the story, I gave the gasp, \\[...0.4s\\] then the sales pro save my ego by asking if I cared about the designer.When I said no, he presented the next suit. Here's the key point. He already had the 1/8 price suit pulled up before my reaction. He knew I would probably gasp, and if your customers don't gasp, then they probably find your premium offer reasonable.So just ask if they want to use the card on file, go for it. Just don't do a gasp of your own when they say, yes, you're welcome, you can buy me a beer later to get more people to buy your main offer, make it a better deal. Only tweak a few features from your premium offer to make your main offer.Every offer has features. Some features matter more than others. You want the primary features to say the same. Fewer people care about the secondary features, so change those. This allows customers to get the same primary features in a way better deal.Most people just want a suit, a few people want a fancy suit. A suit is a primary feature, the material, designer, etc is secondary after anchoring offering the primary feature for one \\[...0.4s\\] fit, the price makes the main offer a great deal.Summary: if you present a more expensive offer before a less expensive offer, more people buy the less expensive offer than they would have on its own.Present anchor get gasp come to the rescue. Present core offer, ask for payment \\[...0.5s\\] for the most effective anchor. Make your premium 5 to 10 times more expensive than your core offer.Anchored customers spend a bit more than they plan to. Don't treat the anchor like a fake, or the customers will too. You lose trust and waste time. Important, some customers will buy the premium offer.Expensive premium offers add outside profits even with just a few sales. The main offer and the premium offer should have the same primary features. The premium offer has different secondary aka premium features \\[...0.4s\\] after anchoring.Offering the primary features for one fit, the price makes the main offer a great deal.

Forward slash training, forward slash money \\[...1.0s\\] roll over up cell \\[...0.5s\\] when I just roll it forward.June 2014, I've been running a win your money back offer, attraction offer No. 1 at my gym for the last year. A 600 dollar fitness program where members could win their money back if they had a goal. It crushed. I sold tons of them, but there was a problem. Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had none.Most winners put their 600 dollars towards 3 months membership. Fine, but then they turned out before their first out of pocket payment, so essentially sold by 6 weeks, get 3 months free, then they leave. Not fine.That 600 dollar thing was my only source of income, so even though I got a bunch of people in the door, my revenue started at zero every month. It was stressful. I had to figure out a better way to boost profit.That's when my friend Justin posted about how he added another hundred members to his recurring revenue. He also attracted customers with when your money back offer, but there was one difference, my customers left and his kept buying stuff.So I invited myself over to spy on him. He was totally cool with it. I spent two days there, and he and I ran some things differently, but nothing that explained why he was doing so much better than me. Do you get lots of people wanting their money back?Yeah, he said. Then how do you deal with all the free time you have to give away free time.Huh, I just roll over their winnings into a year long membership. What? Yeah, we have to do that so they can spread the money out. Spread the money what are you talking about seriously, what you give it all up front? He didn't wait for me to answer.We just give them 50 bucks off per month for a year. So even if they want their money back, they start paying immediately. Of course, I don't want people not paying, sort of business doesn't have paying customers. He laughed. They still get their money back. It just takes a year \\[...0.5s\\] boom.This was it, the missing link in my money model. This one thing \\[...0.6s\\] the roll over upsell changed my life, thousands of gym owners lives and the lives of our customers. The roll over upsell changed everything. Now instead of hoping customers spend money again, I roll over the cost what they just bought towards the next thing. And when paired with more expensive offers, it skyrockets 30 day profits.And although I Learned the roll over upsell this way, you don't need to win your money back offer to use it. You can roll over upsell anyone, anything, even stuff people bought at other businesses.I'll explain later \\[...0.7s\\] description, \\[...0.6s\\] roll over up sales credits some or all of a customer's previous purchase towards your next offer.And this in my experience gets way more people to take it. So once I know how much credit to give, I figure out three things who to upsell, what to upsell, and how to roll over the credit \\[...0.5s\\] for the, who I use roll of or upsells in four situations.First, to reengage customers who left a while ago.Second, to rescue upsell customers as a better alternative to a refund.Third, to rescue other people's upset customers, and fourth, to upsell regular customers. For the what, remember that you can upsell more what they just got, something better or something new and different to make money. Roll their credit over to something more expensive.For the how, \\[...0.4s\\] you can apply all or part of the discount upfront, or spread it over time. \\[...1.4s\\] Examples of roll over up cells \\[...0.6s\\] chiropractor \\[...0.6s\\] reengage old patients with a winback campaign who \\[...0.6s\\] customers with 6 months since their last purchase.What \\[...0.5s\\] new plan, \\[...0.4s\\] how \\[...0.4s\\] up front \\[...0.9s\\] reach out to your old patients, look at their purchase history, offered to apply some or all their past purchases towards something more expensive than what they bought.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.Well, I've got some good news. As a way saying thank you, I want to give you$500 if your money back has credit towards staying pain free for good. Is that of any interest?

Who \\[...0.7s\\] competitors customers. What service agreement? How roll over cost break old agreement.You find competitors upset customers and credit their old purchase with them towards a new purchase with you. Roll over the amount they owe with them as a credit towards a longer agreement with you.Example: hi John, I saw your negative review on their product and it really upset me. To make it up to you, I'll credit whatever payments you have left with them to switch to ours. This way you don't lose a thing and you start giving the benefits now. Fair enough.Membership \\[...1.4s\\] spread first purchase over a term who current customers. What? 12 month membership how spread first purchase? Somebody buys a small block of service or membership time. As soon as they do, you can offer to apply the entire amount towards more time, like 12 months.I can do the rollover upsell at any time, I just prefer to do it right. Then when you do, you take the first purchases cost and apply it as a discount over the longer agreement. For example, a 600 dollar first purchase makes a 50 dollar month rollover discount for 12 months.Important notes: \\[...1.0s\\] use roll over offers to attract new customers. For example, you roll over some or all of what a customers paid somebody else towards your thing. You can find leads for this by scraping contact information from negative product reviews where available.Voila, a hot new leads list of people who want what you have bonus create a way for people to complain about products in your industry. Think of media where people can leave comments, then \\[...0.4s\\] roll over up, sell all of them. Nasty \\[...0.4s\\] do roll over up sells before refunding.

Previous customers are still customers up sell them.Reach out to old customers 6+ months since their last purchase. Look at how much they paid before, decide how much you're willing to roll over \\[...0.4s\\] offer it actually do this. I called these winback campaigns. I made personalized videos for 200 past customers, offering them$4,000 a credit to return.We got about 20% of the people to take the offer. One day recording videos got us an extra$1.9 million to any revenue \\[...0.4s\\] worth it. Add urgency to roll over up cells, make them one time only. If you're spicy, make the moment you present the offer, the time to take it a once in a customer lifetime offer.They don't get to sleep on it, and yes, I know they might not expect it. That's the point you want a surprise and delight, so if they want the credit, they got to take it now. If not, no big deal, they can still pay full price later.How to price your roll over upsell: to make money on a discounted offer, you must have profit left over after you discount it.Since I prefer to make a profit, I try to make the upsell offer at least four times more than the roll over credit. So even if I apply the whole amount to the first purchase, it discounts 25% at most. Remember the rules of discounting apply.Bigger discounts make you less profit for sale, but they get more sales. \\[...1.1s\\] You don't need to credit the entire amount of their first purchase. You can roll over as much or as little of the first purchase as you choose. I roll over whatever amount I think would incentivize them to buy the next thing. Test to find the sweet spot.Pro tip: my famous gift card play: \\[...0.9s\\] you can reuse the roll over upsell as an attraction offer for new and current customers by advertising gift cards for 90% off.Example: 200 dollar gift cards for 20 dollars. Limit them to two per customer, and say they can only use them on other people. They buy them as gifts and give them to your friends. This makes them a great holiday offer.When customers buy the card, ask them who they wanna make it out to, and if they'll make an introduction, then when they come in, roll their gift card over. Make the value of the card 20% of the price, whatever you wanna sell.Next in our example, we sell a 200 dollar gift card for 20 bucks, then apply 200 dollars of value to an offer with at least a thousand dollar price tag. People pay you to refer their prints, it's pretty great, plus you get some pocket change from the cards you sold.Summary points, \\[...0.9s\\] roll over upsells. Credit some or all of customers previous purchases towards your next offer \\[...0.8s\\] to do roll over upsells.Figure out who to upsell, what's upsell, and how to roll credit over.

In the last section, we used upsell offers to get people to buy more stuff. If we did a good job, we've turned a profit to \\[...0.5s\\] another step forward or beyond.Awesome. But what if they say no? We downsell them. Downsein tweaks the original offer to find the highest value solution for the customer's budget.So any offer you make after someone says no is a downsell. I downsell in two ways. I change how much they pay or what they get. For how they pay, I balance how much they pay now with how much they pay over time. For what they get, I change quantity, quality, or offer something different.First, we cover my rules of downselling. They apply to all my downsell processes. Then when we dive into individual offers, you can hit the ground running and downsell. Like a prop \\[...0.5s\\] how not to downsell? A real story for a friend. I was buying a car and the salesman tried to upsell car insurance. The cost.The insurance when he first started was$5,000 I said no, but then he lowered the price \\[...0.6s\\] and I said no again. He kept blowing the price until the same insurance he first offered for$5,000 was now only 400 bucks.I still said no at first. I said no because it was too much money. By the end, I said no because I didn't trust the guy. The entire experience felt dirty. Then I wondered was he ripping me off in the car too? Now I didn't wanna buy the car from him either.People are the price to close a sale, but even if you close this one sale, the customer will question every price you offer from that point going forward.And whoever they tell \\[...0.5s\\] you trade trust for a buck not worth it. No, you can offer something different for less, you just can't offer the same thing for less.If you'd offer different insurance for less rather than the same insurance for us, he probably would have kept her trust and close the sale, \\[...0.6s\\] the rules of downselling, \\[...0.8s\\] remember, they said no to this offer, not all offers.Sometimes, a lot of times people say no, and that's okay, just because they rejected this offer doesn't mean they rejected you.It hurts when someone rejects you, I get it, \\[...0.4s\\] but see it for what it is, an opportunity to find out what they really want and profit from it instead of hiding your head in the sand, stand your ground and make another offer.No means no for this thing, not no for everything. Downsells are traits. When downselling, you work with the customer to find combinations of giving and getting until you get a match.If you're gonna give something, get something \\[...1.2s\\] personalized, don't pressure. Figure out what they like and don't like, then offer more of what they like and less of what they don't with a price to match.You're personalizing here. If someone refuses my large soda up, so I can offer alternatives. I could ask if they want a small, a juice or coffee. Am I being offensive by asking?Absolutely not. In fact, if I can better serve them, it would be offensive not to \\[...1.0s\\] offer the same thing in new ways. In a perfect world, you've got tons of different things to sell, so everybody buys something.In the real world, you limit downsells to what you've got, otherwise you create 100 businesses worth of products and problems. A silly choice. So just think of downselling more, like 100 ways to offer the stuff you already have. Don't drop your price just to get somebody to buy.First off, dropping your price is not really down selling. It's discounting if someone wants what you have \\[...0.4s\\] and just doesn't wanna pay the price tough cookies. On the other hand, you can offer them to pay less now, and pay more money over time a payment plan.But whatever you do, don't just change the price to get someone to buy, because \\[...0.4s\\] customers talk about price. By all means, test prices, plan to offer your thing at a specific price to specific number of people ahead of time.That's way different than charging somebody less in the moment, just because you felt scared of losing the sale in the moment. Customers talk if they find out someone else got the same thing for less, just because you'll upset people. It also becomes an ethical problem, at least to me, avoid it.Next up, I use \\[...0.4s\\] 3 simple and brutally effective downsell processes payment plan down cells, how they pay \\[...0.4s\\] trial with penalty, how they pay \\[...0.5s\\] feature down cells, what they get?These down sale processes boost 30 profit even further.

I had exactly one month's rent and savings left my name, and I never gotten a stranger to give me money, and now I had to get dozens of strangers to give me money in the next few weeks just to keep the lights on.I only made a few sales the first week. If I kept that up, \\[...0.4s\\] it meant going hungry very soon. I had nightmares about going back home, a failure, the idea was unbearable. I got desperate.The next morning, a lead walked in and I went through my normal pitch. She said, I can't afford it. Normally I just give up, but I really needed the money, so in desperation, I blurted out.Okay, when you get paid \\[...0.5s\\] the first, she said, \\[...0.4s\\] okay, just put half down now and half when you get paid. I can't afford that either, she said, \\[...0.5s\\] okay. Do you really want to do this program?Yeah, she said, I do. Okay, what if you do 3 payments and just put a third down today? I still can't do it. Hmm, what can you do? Honestly, nothing, \\[...0.4s\\] but I can pay for the whole thing on the 1st, \\[...0.4s\\] my rent was due in the fifth, \\[...0.5s\\] bingo, sounds good.

I know how to use them, and I'll show you exactly how to.Payment plans are gamble because they can make money in one way, but they can lose money in two. They make you more money when you get more customers and those customers complete their payments.They make you less money when people cancel before you turn a profit. You lose the most money when people who would have paid in full take a payment plan and then cancel early. This chapter maximizes how much money you make from payment plans and minimizes the money you lose. I take the bet when I know I'll win with this playbook, you can too.Description: \\[...0.6s\\] when most people think down sell, they think of a lower amount, lower quality, cheaper, and so on. Fair enough, but I like to down sell by offering the same product again.I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. Instead of offering a different thing, I spread the cost by charging some of it up front and putting the rest into schedule payments. I call this a payment plan down sell. Let's go over how they work.Many people reject offers because they cost too much. Sometimes true, but in response to this, business owners and other sales professionals will immediately discount or steal cheaper stuff just to get them say yes.However, a huge percentage of the time, it cost too much, really means this cost too much up front. In other words, people think discounts work because people pay less for the product when you peel it back a layer. It's really because they pay less in the moment.So payment plans get the best of both worlds. They get more buyers because customers pay less in the moment. They also boost your profits because customers still pay full price over time.My payment plan down sales process takes up to 7 steps. The process shifts from getting paid more upfront to getting paid more over time. I stop when they buy. Here are the steps. Step one, \\[...0.4s\\] reward for paying in full rather than punish for paying over time.Step 2: \\[...0.5s\\] offer third party financing, credit card and lay away options. Step 3: offer half now, half later. Step 4: check to see if they still want the thing. Step 5: offer a split into three payments. Step 6: offer to evenly spread the payments.Step 7: offer a free trial. Let's go through the mid order \\[...0.7s\\] example of payment plan down cell process.Step 1: step 1: reward for paying in full rather than punish for paying over time. If I take on the risk of a payment plan, I increase the price. Normally, businesses do it by charging interest, but I do it by offering a discount if they pay in full.Think about how businesses normally charge interest. They basically say it's$10 if you get it right now, but it's$15 if you pay it for time because we charge$5 interest, no fund.Instead, I say it's$15, but it's$10 if you prepay it. You save five bucks. That's what most people do. To do this, I present the price with interest included, then I offer pre payment as a way to get a discount.This way, we make the offer friendlier \\[...0.4s\\] and benefit from a price anchor. Same math better feels. If they said no, I start downselling, but even still, I try to get paid first.Step 2: \\[...0.4s\\] offer third party financing, credit card, and layaway options.Third party financing: \\[...0.4s\\] this means another company pays me now and the customer has to pay a payment plan with that other company. Car dealers do it all the time. The dealer gets the money from the financing company today and the customer pays the financing company tomorrow.Note: it takes work to get 3rd party financing set up, but totally worth the effort.Credit card: \\[...0.5s\\] just ask, would you rather I decide your payment terms or you decide? They say normally that they prefer to decide. And when they do, I tell them, use your credit card that way. I could pay today and then they can pay the credit card company overtime.It's wild to me that this reframe works, but it does. I don't judge. I do \\[...0.8s\\] layaway. Layaway means paying off the product before getting it. Customers can make as many installments as they want, they can take \\[...0.4s\\] any reasonable amount of time to pay, but they only get the product after they paid in full. This is by far the most flexible for them and the lowest risk to us. If they say no to these, I move to step three.Step 3, \\[...0.4s\\] offer half now, half later. I start by asking when's the next time you get paid. After I ask \\[...0.4s\\] one of just put half down a day and the rest when you get paid. If they can't do that, I ask what's the most you can put down today?When they offer an amount, I say great, we'll put that down today and put the rest when you get paid.Fair enough, I like scheduling payments off paycheck since that's when most people get paid every two weeks. This boots 30 day profit far more than monthly payments. If they can't do those, I pause to make sure they actually want it. \\[...1.3s\\] Step 4, check to see if they still want the thing.No payment plan will satisfy customer who doesn't want the thing, so make sure the person actually wants your thing before putting more effort into selling it.I might say something like, got it, so money is tight right now, real quick, I just wanna make sure on a scale from 1 to 10, how bad do you wanna do this? If they say 8 or above, keep offering payment plans and say \\[...0.4s\\] awesome.Don't worry, we're gonna figure a way out to make this happen for you. If they say 7 or below, ask why not a 10? And then say something like, you're right, I think we may have something that could be better for you.Then you sell them something different, which I'll cover and feature down cells a little later.Step 5: offer split into three payments. If they said \\[...0.5s\\] 8 to 10 on the scale, I can down sell from half down to a third down. Offer a three payment option, one third now and one third of the next two paychecks, or one third now and one third next two months.Step six, \\[...0.7s\\] often evenly spread payments. If they still can't manage it, I evenly spread payments over the rest of their service. For instance, gym launch was 16 weeks long, so I charge them each week 16 times in total.If that still creates problem, I move on to step seven. Offer a free trial. I offer free trials in a special way, so I dedicate the next chapter to it, but the sale ends here, at least for now.This payment plan downsell process makes up the nine offers, and if you think that sounds crazy, you're probably making way less money and serving way fewer customers than you could.Important notes. See, saw downselling. If you prefer fewer steps or have less experience salespeople, then you can use this payment plan downsell process instead of asking for the full amount. Just ask, would you rather have giant monthly payments or tiny ones?They'll say tiny, then you say normally it cost X, \\[...0.4s\\] and if you prepay it today, you'll get a huge discount in zero monthly payments that work.This frames the payment plan as negative and highlights the benefits of prepaying. Then if they say they can't afford it, say the more they can put down now, the lower their monthly payments.If you can't afford it up front, I totally get it, which suggest the down payment, so you get the monthly rate you like. This still incentiveizes bigger down payments to get their monthly payments lower. If they still say no, ask if they still want the product.If they do, \\[...0.4s\\] pull your chair to their side of the table and walk them through the options.The sale becomes a team effort. Straightforward \\[...1.5s\\] payment plans have built in upsells. Make periodic offers for the original paid full discount during the payment plan. If they pay off the balance, they can still get the original prepaid discount.This works exceptionally well. Customers forget they have the option, so when we give it to them, some jump at the opportunity.Also give your sales guys the same bonus to close the balance to incentivize the follow up. And remember, if you give people the option to pay slower, they will pay slower. If you incentivize them pay faster, they will pay faster.So if you want them to pay faster, give them a good reason to. In other words, you can extend the prepayment discount for the first 30 days of their relationship with you. And that gives you 30 more days to collect more cash upfront, get fewer decline payments. Align payment schedules with paycheck schedules. If you charge on days people get paid, they have a higher chance of paying.Also, people's paychecks get deposited at different times, so if it first, it gets declined, run it a few times that day. I Learned the strategy from John, my early mentor.I often recoup a third of my decline payments by adding this little process. \\[...1.1s\\] How to make sure payment plans make you money. After implementing payment plans, your close rate should increase.Duh, but if the number of paid fools goes down, you have a problem. You just put people who would have paid in full on payment plans, so you wanna close more points overall, but with the same percentage of appointments paying in full.Example, if I talk to 10 leads, I might sell three. If I have a down cell, I might sell three more for a total of six.So in the second scenario, I get my upfront cash from the first three and the payment plans from the second three. This make sure the down cells properly increase your 30 day profits.Another reason to start high before working your way down \\[...0.7s\\] profit. Well, a company that manages subscriptions reported turn data from 14,000 businesses. They uncovered this valuable gem across all businesses. The billing cadence affected monthly turn. Monthly as in 12 times a year billing resulted in 10.7% monthly cancellation rates.Quarterly billing as in four times per year billing resulted in 5% monthly cancellation rates, and annual billing one time per year billing resulted in 2% monthly cancellations.I already present pricing an order of most cashier front to least, so just so happens. This also makes customers more viable over the long term. So start high, \\[...0.4s\\] fewer bigger payments and work your way down bottom line. Changing how customers pay can make a massive difference in how long they stay.We go in more depth on continuity and turn in Section 6\\. Continuity offers \\[...0.6s\\] summary points. Payment plan downsell: spread the cost of a product by charging some of it up front and putting the rest into scheduled payments. Payment plans get more buyers to like discounts, but can also boost profits because they agree to pay full price.Over time, payment plans only grow your business if they get more customers and those customers actually pay. Step 1: present at full price, then offer a discount if they pay in full.Step 2: third party financing, then credit card option, then lay away option. Step 3: split the payment into schedule on their paycheck dates. Step 4: ask if they still want the product on a scale from 1 to 10\\. You want 8 or greater. Step 5: split the payment in three, split on their paycheck dates or monthly. Step 6: schedule equal payments across a specified period of time.Step 7: offer a free trial in exchange for putting a card down covered in the next chapter. See salt down selling gradually shifts from paid in full to equal payments. Payment plan Upsale: they get the original discount price if they pay the balance today. Line payment schedules with paycheck schedules to get fewer decline payments.At the end of all of this, if someone still refuses to pay anything, then we offer them a free trial in exchange for their card. But it's not an ordinary free trial. I do in a special way. It took me years to perfect it, so that's where we're gonna go to next, and you're gonna love it.Free gift \\[...0.4s\\] down, so offers video training, properly designed payment plants almost always make you more sales and more money. I recorded myself actually doing the step downs, so you can model them for whatever you sell for those you like to learn in multiple formats, which I recommend. You can watch it.I made it for you at acquisition. Com forward slash training, forward slash money \\[...0.5s\\] trial with penalty. If you do X y Z, I'll let you start for free.Spring 2018, \\[...0.5s\\] Jim Watch was scaling fast with 100 poison counting. Layla needed better HR solutions to manage it all. After months of sales calls with prospective HR companies, she found one she liked, \\[...0.5s\\] and to my surprise, it wasn't anything special, looked like all the others. Yeah, the software is complicated, she said.They got me \\[...0.4s\\] seriously how they manage that, \\[...0.5s\\] they had a trial offer with a weird spin. It was pretty smart what they offer. They said if I did their training, I'd get free onboarding, but if I skip the training, I'd have to pay for it.So what'd you do? I went through the training, of course. So they took your card, you did the training, and then you didn't have to pay for the onboarding. Yep, she smirked, and now I can actually use the complicated software too. Lightbulb moment, wait, \\[...0.5s\\] you said no.Then they downsold you a free trial on the condition they could penalize you if you didn't use it \\[...0.4s\\] basically, I mean, it makes sense, it forced me to learn, and now I don't wanna learn anyone else's complicated software, so we're sticking with them.You're right, that is pretty smart. The software company used trial penalty as their attraction offer, but I prefer it to downsell trials. So I only downsell the trial if they say no to my first offer. And if you do it the way I'm about to show you, it only changes what they pay today, not how much they pay in total \\[...0.6s\\] description.In a trial with penalty offer, customers can try your product or service for free so long as they meet your terms for comparison. When your money back offers, attraction offer No. 1, give customers the chance to get their money back if they meet your terms.In trial with penalty offers, customers only pay if they don't meet them. Ideally, the term should be things that make excellent customers, so they'll mirror the actions and results used in your win your money back offer. But this time we use avoiding fees rather than winning money back to incentivitis adherents. So try with penalty isn't here's my thing.See if you like it, it's, here's my thing. You get it for free so long as you do the stuff which makes you perfect fit for my next offer. And if you don't, then you have to pay for it \\[...0.7s\\] to do a try with penalty down.So \\[...0.6s\\] you must consider what they have to do to avoid the fee and how you charge them. Normally, you get one chunk of people to buy your main offer, so offer that first and the rest you get on this down.So \\[...0.5s\\] let's see you normally close three out of 10 people on your upfront cash offer. Now you downsell another four on a trial with penalty. Then after the trial finishes, upsell three of them. You go from three sales to six, doubling your customers.If you only have one offer, you lose to everyone who says no. Downselling trials with a penalty gives people another chance to say, yes, \\[...0.5s\\] I'm still irritated at the thousands of customers. I've lost some free trials over the years before learning this, but now we can save them \\[...0.4s\\] the trial with penalty makes it happen.Examples: \\[...0.8s\\] business to consumer offer \\[...0.4s\\] 28 day kick that habit blueprint. To get the trial for free and avoid the penalty fee, you must attend all your consulting calls, post your progress pictures in the group once a week, journal daily in our app, attend feedback sections, attend feedback sessions and transformations aka upsell opportunities \\[...0.6s\\] business to business offer 5 day, get your first 5 customers challenge to get the draw for free and avoid the penalty fee, you must send 100 outbound messages per day.Report stats on this outbound messages. Attend the daily training, post in the group. Once you've done your homework, attend your graduation call \\[...0.4s\\] up sell Opportunity \\[...0.5s\\] Software$500 \\[...0.7s\\] onboarding for HR software, then$99 per month thereafter.Try with penalty. You don't have to pay$500 up front, but you must attend onboarding, which is \\[...0.4s\\] 3: 60 minutes.Zoom calls up some opportunities. Do the homework, activate your employer profile, get your employees set up by the end of the third call, otherwise you pay the fee. Important: notes what they get for free and what they have to do to avoid the fee.You'll need to know what your terms of service will be. The valuable parts will either be your bare bones offer, like the decoy offer or your win your money back offer.Either work. I'd recommend giving more rather than giving less if you can afford it. Their criteria should activate and retain customers. You can swipe these directly from when your money back attraction offer No.1: breaking up fees \\[...0.5s\\] versus 1 lump fee. Say you have a 500 dollar product with 10 things to do. I'd rather Bill 50 dollars for each mess up than one 500 dollar fee for their first mess up. On the other hand, if missing once really messes up their success. You want the fee to reflect that. I've seen both work. How to down sell the trial.Here's a graphic to show how I downsell a trial with penalty in 5 steps: \\[...0.7s\\] step 1: offer the trial last. If someone makes it clear they don't want your first offer, then downsell the trial with penalty. Here's how I might sound. Hmm, that sure is a pickle.I'll tell you what. How about we just get you started for free? Would you be okay with that? We can just help you out, and if you like it, you can stay. Let me get your ID and we get the process started.Fair enough, \\[...0.4s\\] great. Step 2, always get a card, \\[...0.5s\\] record their info, hold on their ID \\[...0.5s\\] and motion for their credit card, saying \\[...0.5s\\] what card you want to use. They have to leave a card if they bulk, just say that's how you've always done it. If they still refuse, wish them a lovely day and show them out.Pro tip, if someone doesn't agree to put their car down and do the work, I won't tell them, they complain more and convert less. Not worth hassle.Step 3: \\[...0.7s\\] always sell staying and paying. Ask directly \\[...0.4s\\] if this program got you the result, will you stay long term? You want them to agree to staying long term if you get them results. If they say no, there's no point in giving them a trial.Then we frame the conversation as if they'll stay long term even if we haven't started building them yet. So if they say no, but want more explanation, say something like this, \\[...0.5s\\] I don't want you to try it.I want you to get results and out of integrity, I wanna set realistic goals. You're not gonna hit your long term goals during this trial, but you will establish the habits to help you get them. And we're gonna help you do that for free, but if you wanna get your long term results, you're gonna have to stay on after.I just wanna make sure that you're not looking for a quick fix, because I ethically can't promise you that once they agree, move on to step 4\\. Explain the fees after getting their card.I'll say something like, we will do our part so long as you do yours. That's fair, right? So now I just ask that you bet on yourself, if you miss or skip any stuff, your results will suffer. We charge to keep you on track. If you miss no big deal, you'll get dinged a little fee, but it'll get you back on track if you follow through, then you get all this for free.So this is the best way we can get you amazing results and keep it free for you, best of both worlds. Note, if you explain the fees before you get the card, you'll get more resistance, so explain after \\[...0.4s\\] with a little, this is how we've always done it, attitude.People still have to agree to the fees. You'll get a higher take rate doing it this way. I always have customers initial separately next to the fee clause to force my sales guys to explain it to them. Step 5, make check ins required.First, we explain all criteria, so they understand the cost and benefits of adhering. Then we draw attention to the check ins, our up sale opportunities. Yep, and you agree to attend each of these 3 check ins.First, we do X, say that you can, second, do y, say that you can, third, do Z, say that you can. Obviously, we charge if you miss these, because it's the only way that you can get results.How I upsell from a trial? \\[...1.8s\\] When someone takes a trial, one of three things happen. They like it, they hate it, or they don't use it. Here's how I upsell them for each of these scenarios. If they like it, this is the easy one. You already have them set up for automatic billing.Great. Meet with them many ways \\[...0.4s\\] you can still offer a longer term or higher value version of your service, or both. Successful customers tend to get even more value out of your better and more profitable stuff.2. If they hate it, turn that frown upside down. Ask them what they would have liked to be different. Tell them they're totally right and that you're angry at yourself for missing this.Do not blame them. Only one person can be angry, and it needs to be you. Ask if they'll give you a chance to make it up to them because of how outraged you are at their experience.And now since you better understand their needs that there are better fit for your higher level thing. Then offer to them.Yes, this is a sale. I get about half of these people to buy \\[...0.6s\\] 3 \\[...0.6s\\] if they didn't use it, \\[...0.5s\\] reach out to people multiple times before they get to this point. Explain that you need to meet with them. Offer to wave the fee. If they do meet with you, now you can try and get them back on track or off something better for them.I don't like billing non starters. Personally, a small fee isn't worth a one star view. But hey, it's your choice. Tweak your trial to get the most customers if no one takes your trial. Lower the requirements or penalties if people take your trial but don't fall Through. Emphasize explaining how fees help them, and make sure to include your sales meeting as mandatory.If people don't stay on the back end better, emphasize the value of staying and paying. Get better at delivering, and make sure that what you saw on the back end makes sense with what you saw on the front end.If you start printing money, don't stop. Let people make up for goofs. People often get discouraged after getting billed, but you can offer an opportunity to make it up. This does a great job of getting people back on track and converting, but if they miss it, you're justified ability. \\[...1.1s\\] Just call it a trial.Even though the trial with penalty has some special features, you should just call it a free trial. Otherwise people may get scared and confused.No one wants to be penalized. And if they ask you why you free trials this way, just reply with this is how we've always done it, or people just get best results this way. Pay list now or pay more later versus trial with penalty.I use Payless now or pay more later as a downso for physical products or one time services, and I use trial with penalty as a downso for recurring products or services.Also, I've only made this work in businesses where the customer has to do work to get results. If you find other types of businesses these work, let me know. \\[...1.0s\\] Discounts, get cards on file.Some people get weird when you offer free stuff and ask for a card, and if you have a super low price, it justifies asking for the card.The small price means the card will probably work when the automatic payment starts. So instead of free month, you might offer first month for a dollar, then extra dollars per month when it occurs. So you can have a$1 trial rather than a free trial. It works the same way.Summary points: in a trial with penalty offer, customers can try your product or service for free so long as they meet your terms. Trial with penalty downsell offers: get yeses from people who would have said no \\[...0.4s\\] to do them.Get the card, get the commitment. Explain what they have to do to get results, and the meetings they must attend, and what happens if they don't. Trials with penalties get more paying customers than normal free trials, because they use your product more and actually get value from it. Use the same refund criteria from when your money back attractional 4.1 to create your trial with penalty criteria. This way at the end of the trial, they've done the stuff that makes great long term customers, and advertise your business for free. You can break up fees by criteria, or you can charge a lump fee. I like breaking them up.You make money by getting people results and turning them into customers, not nickel and diming them with fees. Use mid trial check ins to make more offers.If they love it, give them more of what they love. If they have problems with it, swap it for what makes sense for them. If they aren't using it, offer them the ability to make it up to avoid the fees. Free gift, \\[...0.5s\\] free trial training.Not all businesses can do free trials, but if you can, it's a hell of a downsell.There's obviously right and wrong ways to do them, and right and wrong businesses do them in. I made a free video for you covering this chapter and as many details as I could. You can watch it at acquisition. Com for slash training for slash money, for free. Enjoy. Feed your downsells. Why don't we try this instead? I can't remember one in 2019.This new down cell triple my clothes rate from 25% to 75% last quarter, and even crazier, more people bought the main thing he said between bites, \\[...0.9s\\] you started offering a payment plan or discount.Neither payment plans take too long, discounts devalue my product. Huh, we talk about a high ticket product, right?Yep, \\[...0.4s\\] Jeez, what are you doing? I lower the price, but I justify it by cutting a feature that way. I'm not discounting, so what feature did you cut? My full money back guarantee. I never thought of guarantees as a feature, super wait, you downsaw by removing your guarantee.Yep, works great. We get a price objection. We just say, \\[...0.4s\\] if you don't want the option to get your money back, you can pay less or you can keep your money back guarantee.Which would you prefer? Once they understand what they give up, they often say, screw it, I'd rather get the guarantee and get my money back. Ah, so they only see the value of the guarantee after you remove it. And that also explains why so many people buying the main thing. Clever.Then I followed up how the numbers break down. Before I only had one full price option. So if 100 people got on a call, 25 bought. Now 35 people buy the main thing and 40 take the downsell. So it up to full price buyers, total close rate and cash up front.Nice, \\[...0.4s\\] yeah, changed my life. He said \\[...1.0s\\] the last two chapters covered payment plan downsells and trial with penalty. We downsold by keeping the overall price the same, only changing when and how they paid. In this chapter, we cover feature downsells with these.We downsold by lowering the price, but instead of a discount which makes the same stuff cheaper, we lower the price by changing what they get.Description, \\[...0.4s\\] feature down sales, lower prices by changing what customers get. I do them by offering less quantity, lower quality, lower price alternatives or cutting optional components.All features have a price and a value. If you remove something, the price goes down, sure, but the value goes down to \\[...0.4s\\] what features remove and how much you lower. The price affect how good of a deal the person gets.This change in your offers price to value affects how people buy. People want to get the best deal for them. For instance, if you remove stuff they hate and lower the price a little, they get a better deal. If you remove stuff they love and lower the price a little, they get a worse deal.Both get people to buy in the story. Customers love the guarantee, the guarantee had far more value than its price.So even if they said no at first, removing the guarantee instantly showed its value. Customers saw the higher priced offer as a better deal, so after seeing the downsell option, they bought the first offer.People will see the value, the thing you removed after they see the difference in price, as in people weigh how much \\[...0.4s\\] money they save against the value they lose.So clever feature downselling gets customers to re upsell themselves on more expensive offers. This means you wanna remove features from highest to lowest value since people want more value for their money. This instead advises customers to make the highest value purchase for them.Feature down sales have a simple formula, take something away, lower the price, and in so many words, ask how about now feature down sell.Examples, \\[...0.5s\\] feature downselling product and service quantity. For services, this might mean a lower amount, fewer sessions, less time, or shorter duration. \\[...1.1s\\] For products, it means fewer of them, \\[...0.6s\\] product quantity down.So \\[...0.4s\\] instead of a three month supply, how about we just start with one \\[...0.5s\\] service quantity down? So \\[...0.4s\\] instead of 4 sessions per month, why don't you just start it to \\[...0.6s\\] feature downselling product quality, think older versions, less reliable materials, materials of lower social status, etc.Product quality down. So \\[...0.5s\\] instead of leather seats, we can do vinyl. How's that sound? \\[...1.1s\\] Feature downselling service quality. This means a lot of things.I'll give you a few ways I change quality of services. Hint: this also works to increase service quality. Service quality downsell. Instead of 5 minute response times, why don't we start you at overnight response time? You'll save some money and you'll still get your answers. Just for the small delay, \\[...0.8s\\] more service quality features. Time availability \\[...0.4s\\] come specific times versus whenever you want.Days of week: Monday, Wednesday, Friday versus any day. Times of day: 9 to 5 versus 24 hours. Amount of time: 15 minutes of protocols versus 60 minutes of protocols. Location availability: \\[...0.6s\\] this one location forces all locations we own. Cancellations, reschedule fees versus \\[...0.4s\\] reschedule whenever you want for free. \\[...1.2s\\]Speed of response: reply in minutes versus hours versus days. Speed of delivery: wait in line versus priority \\[...0.4s\\] versus same day, next day versus next week.Service ratio: \\[...0.4s\\] 1 on 1 versus 1 to many versus many to 1\\. Communication method: tech support versus chat support versus video call support. Provider qualifications: owner versus longtime employee versus new employee, \\[...0.6s\\] live versus recorded.Watch it happening now versus watch it after it happens later. DIY \\[...0.7s\\] versus DWY versus DFY, do it yourself versus done with you versus done for you.Expirations, \\[...0.4s\\] works forever versus works for ex time versus works only at specific times.

So, but I don't let anyone pay less, just because \\[...0.6s\\] maintain the position of a help of guide.Remember, feature down selling means trying to find the best deal for them. This keeps the conversion collaborative rather than competitive. If you act pushy, your offers will exhaust customers faster.If you stay a helpful guide, you can down sell as many offers as necessary without exhausting the customer.Tweak your feature down sale process. We have the job of making the product have the highest value to cost in the eyes of the customer. But in the beginning, you won't know much about the customer's preferences.So as you solve the same problems for the same type of customer, you learn what they find the most valuable. Once you do, you can standardize your feature down sale process. Feature down sales close more people when you have feature combinations set ahead of time. How I standardize my downsell process.First, I cut something valuable and lower the price a little. I do this to get them to reconsider the original offer price. If that fails, I continue removing features and lowering the price until they buy. I'd rather people buy something than get nothing. Name your feature combinations.Name the most expensive combination after a statue of customer would find aspirational, the whale package, the total transformation, the High Roller, etc. Look at airlines, make your version of first class business class, economy.I need my cheapest combination, the minimum. I like it because implies they have to at least get that. If someone rejects all of the packages, I just say so nothing more than the minimum package, then to get them to say no to say yes, like the classic op.So \\[...0.6s\\] temperature check after two down cells just like the payment plan.

Then recombine the features and try to accommodate their 10 note. This means you can alternate between payment plans and feature down cells.When you use both become very difficult to refuse after each downsell ask deal or fair enough, this works astonishingly well. Fewer people will see you the change in your offer for them, and then say no, that's not fair.Listen to how I present the feature downsells on episode 2\\. 0\\. 2 of my podcast, The Game, How to Close Everyone Downselling like a Pro, which you can listen to on Spotify or apple or iTunes, or wherever you listen to podcasts, free orientations boost, do it yourself feature down cells.Once someone has refused all my done for you offers, I ask even though we're not gonna work together on X, I still wanna help.How about you just come in for free orientation on X tomorrow? At the end of the orientation, I offer a DIY product that solves the same problem as the done for you service. For example, I offered a free orientation to people, refused my fitness offer.Of the people who shut up to the orientation, about half, almost all of them bought supplements. It got me money from people who otherwise said no free money for little extra work. \\[...1.2s\\] Feature downsell your guarantees.If you already have a guarantee, make removing it part of your feature downsell process. People value security, so removing it gets many to realize its value.This often flips an initial no back to a yes. Feature downsell current customers. Customers who use all the features they pay for keep paying longer than customers who don't.So once you see a customer isn't using a feature, offer a lower price, only paying for the features they use. Do this proactively. They'll either tell you they wanna keep it and might start using it again, or they'll be happy you gave them a better deal. It takes work, but it beats them actually canceling fun fact.Customers weave downsold into a lower package just for them have the 2nd highest LTV of all my customers. When people have a product they like at a price they find fair, they tend to keep paying for it.Barter with reviews, testimonials and referrals.

Feature down sales, lower prices. By removing stuff, you take something away, lower the price and ask how about now.Typical feature down sales, offer less quantity, lower quality, cheaper alternatives, or remove features altogether.

It can help you make your stuff super profitable while staying attractive to the customer. This is one of my favorite topics, and I made you an additional training that covers it. You can watch it as always at acquisition.Com forward slash training, forward slash money down cell offers conclusion. Everybody buys something.Down sales give you another shot at getting customer by turning nose in DSS for that reason, it's less about having 100 different products for the same offer, and more about having 100 different offers for the same product. But no matter what the offer is, never the same stuff for cheaper. We just keep tweaking the offer until we make it the best deal for them.The extra cash explodes our 30 day profits and blows us past our goals. So we've used attraction offers to get customers to buy once. We've used upsells to get them to buy the next thing.And now I've showed you the three most powerful downsell processes in case they say no \\[...0.5s\\] payment plan down cells, travel penalty and feature down cells.Next we've got the final stage of a hundred million dollar money model, continuity offers, how to keep them buying for good. Section 5: continuity offers. You can shear sheep for a lifetime, but you can only skin it once.John, an early mentor, \\[...0.5s\\] I've been a continuity guy my entire life. Personal fitness, then gyms, then gym licensing and supplements, then software, and now with acquisition.Com, lots of stuff. Needless to say, I'm a fan. Main reason \\[...0.4s\\] when you do continuity, right, you get more customers and make more from them. Continuity offers provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing payments for until they cancel. They boost the profit from every customer and give you one last thing to sell.Continuity offers are awesome because you sell once but get paid again and again. Let me explain. Let's say you offer a thousand dollar thing to 100 people and 10 buy, you make$10,000 10 times a thousand dollars.Now let's say you offer the same thing to a hundred people, but you make a thousand dollar thing$50 a month instead. At 50 bucks, we can get 40 out of the hundred people to buy. And if you keep those people for 20 months, you still make$1,000 from every customer.So you go from making$10,000 now and$0 over time to$2,000 now and$40,000 over time. And as an added bonus in the first example, if you only sell 10 customers, you only have 10 customers to upsell.Later, if you used a continuity offer and sold 40 customers, you'd have four times the customers dubsolator, a massive difference.This illustrates the pros and cons of continuity. You can attract more customers compared to something more expensive, but you make way less money. Now that makes it tough to use an attraction offer on its own, even if you have more money making potential tomorrow. Continuity attraction offers leave you strap for cash today.By making continuity offers last. We get the best of all worlds. We get cash today from attraction offers, up sell offers and down sell offers. We get a little cash today and a tons of cash tomorrow from continuity offers.To be clear, you can make continuity offers wherever and however you want. They can attract new customers up sell down sell current customers, and re engage all customers.Also, \\[...0.4s\\] only some stuff makes sense for a continuity offer. It's silly for someone to pay for a one day workshop forever. It makes sense for them to pay until they cover the cost, and that makes it a payment plan. At the same time, you probably make a mistake to offer a single price, even a big price to provide a service forever.If your customers get ongoing value, it probably makes sense for them make ongoing payments. The 3 continuity offers, \\[...0.5s\\] all offers depend on getting customers to buy it, but continuity offers depend on getting customers to keep buying.I get them to do both by combining bonuses, discounts and fees. \\[...1.7s\\] Offer 1, continuity bonus offers, offer 2, continuity discount offers, offer 3, the waived fee offer.Now that we've got that covered, you can't get customers to stick to your continuity unless they started. So let's start there. Free gift \\[...0.5s\\] continuity and continuity offers training.Almost every business I've built has been driven by continuity. It's a snowball that grows and grows. I made a video for you that outlines more training on the topic. You can watch it free without giving your email at acquisition. Com for such training for such money continuity bonus offers. If you like this, you're gonna love what I have next.Fall 2019, \\[...0.5s\\] I taught gym owners how to sell six week challenges, and they were making money handover fist. But some of them weren't that good at converting people into continuity after the challenge.Then out of the blue, I saw a gym that used to struggle posting numbers way higher than some of our best performers. Naturally, I investigated, dude, your numbers are insane, how do you get so many members?I asked, \\[...1.1s\\] I'm not really doing the six week challenge. You said, wait, what do you mean? You're marketing six week challenges though, right? Yeah, but I offer them something else when they come in. Okay, help me understand, \\[...0.4s\\] so we go through the normal pitch, we explain the price, yada, yada.As soon as they say they're interested, we ask if they wanna get it for free. Of course, they say yes, then I tell them that if they become a member, we'll make it free, which they love. And on top of that, if they become members, they also get member exclusive bonuses, members get better class times attaining booth VIP events, all sort of cool stuff.It converts like crazy last, we upsell a discount of prepaid membership, how's that go? I asked, well, for anyone who joins, we merely say want to see if even more money they lean in. We offer a prepaid discount and bonus for 6 months of membership.This is awesome. Does anyone even take the original challenge offer anymore? Some do sure can't be mad about more offering cash. He said, I dig it, break down some of your numbers, would you?He continued \\[...0.6s\\] before we get 34 out of 100 to sign up for the challenge, then a few weeks later, we convert half 17 to stay now we only get, like, 15 to sign up for the challenge, but we get 40 straightening continuity, and of those 40, about eight of them take the six month prepaid up sale.So let me get this straight, you tripled membership sales, and you still get up front cash from challenges, and you stack even more up front cash from prepaid memberships.He could barely contain his grant, and for good reason, his tiny tweak was genius \\[...0.7s\\] description. With continuity bonuses, you give the customer an awesome thing if they sign up today. Typically the bonus itself has more value than the first continuity payment.That's all there is to it. Bonus \\[...0.5s\\] adding value \\[...0.7s\\] for products. You can give away many small things or one big product that complements the subscription for services you give away to find program on boarding setup or feature that adds value \\[...0.5s\\] discount lowering costs.Remember, \\[...0.5s\\] anything you offer for free, you can also offer as a discount. Free stuff and discounts both affect how we make decisions. So we wanna do both to get the benefits of both \\[...0.4s\\] when making continuity offers. I get more people to start if I add more good stuff bonuses and take away more bad stuff discounts. And of course, it all works better with a dash of urgency if they join now.Also, you can offer the bonus as standalone purchase, or you can only make it available if they buy your continuity. Either works \\[...0.6s\\] on their own. Continuity offers get less cash now, and that makes it tough for getting customers profitably. But the way I use them, we can still hit our 30 day profit goals.Here's how: first I like to do all my big cash attraction offers, upsell and downsell offers.Then continuity offers get a little bit of cash for the first month's payment. Then I offer people who bought one month a discount on prepaying more months. This further boost 30 day profits, giving me more cash to advertise and stacks recurring revenue. Not too shabby. \\[...1.4s\\]Author note: \\[...0.6s\\] no successful continuity business I've seen has a standalone membership offer, they all have other bells and whistles to upsell.Main reason continuity offers are tough to advertise profitably. Nobody wants to make a recurring commitment to something they haven't tried. To make up for this, businesses attract customers with stuff like trials, then once people join, they upsell other features in longer term prepayment options.This gets them the cash they need to advertise while building the recurring revenue.Examples of getting people to start on continuity: \\[...1.2s\\] physical product: \\[...0.5s\\] Pet Food continuity offer one time bonus, get every dog toy you've ever made for free and 800 dollar value when you sign up for monthly dog food chipments for$59 a month. Monthly bonuses: you'll get a new dog toy every month as a member \\[...1.3s\\] service.Short term accelerator: offer \\[...1.0s\\] one time bonus, short term accelerator cost$1,000 on its own.Get it free when you become a member for$100 a month. Bonus package the VIB community enjoys first in line access to our events, longer support hours, and better support reps. Digital products: offer \\[...0.6s\\] one time bonus: \\[...0.5s\\] get all my past 40 news letters died at 15,880 by becoming a member today only for$399 per month.After 30 day trial \\[...0.4s\\] limited discount plus lifetime bonus, and if you pay today you can unlock a lifetime discount to$200 per month. Get early digital access and a physical copy every month. Note: use the elements from the feature down cells to create better bonuses.Important notes: \\[...0.6s\\] focus on the bonus, not the membership. Join my membership program isn't nearly as compelling as get this free viable thing. So advertise that, then explain the rest after they show interest. Bonuses kind of work like up cells, more of the same.You get 2 years of past newsletters for free by becoming a member \\[...0.4s\\] complimentary, you get nutrition services for free when you sign up for a fitness membership \\[...0.4s\\] upgrade, you get a gold membership when you buy a bronze membership.Limited availability. \\[...1.2s\\] Keep your bonuses related to your core offer. If the bonus is too different, you'll attract the wrong customers. For instance, don't advertise a free T-shirt to upsell tech services, but advertising a free T-shirt to upsell T-shirt printing makes sense.Make bonuses things you already have and do. For instance, the past 2 years of newsletters cost no extra time but are super high value.And onboarding is something that you have to do with a client anyways, so you might as well slap a price on it and give it to him as a bonus. If you value it, they will too. Physical bonuses and digital products, and digital bonuses.With physical products, if I have a digital membership, I might offer a hat, shirt or tool, etc. Related to the offer. If I have a physical Proctor service like a boxing gym membership, offering to live stream classes can get more people to sign up.This strategy often lowers the cost of getting customers more than the cost of the bonus, and that's the point. Also, if some people take the bonus and run, the lower advertising cost, still make up for it. If customers are too expensive, give it a try. Use realistic bonus pricing.The bigger the value anchor on your bonus, the more compelling the offer. But you also have to make that anchor believable. Some business owners make up ridiculous values. Don't do this, it won't anchor the customer, and you'll lose trust with them.This is a great opportunity to give away products you sold before you can anchor their actual prices as real discounts. At bonuses, \\[...1.2s\\] you can bonus your customers by giving them titles.Consider giving customers titles after they stay 3, 6, or 12 months beyond titles like Silver, Gold, Diamond, Double Diamond, etc.A good friend of mine does this, and after a while, she found her customers cared more about the title than the other bonuses. She told me that they even introduced themselves to her by their title.So if you can't think of something to give them, at the very least you can call them something special. \\[...1.6s\\] You can make free bonuses discounts, and make discounts, free bonuses, \\[...0.4s\\] free bonus, become a member for$200, then you get this thousand dollar program as a free bonus.Steep discount \\[...0.4s\\] gets the thousand dollar program for$1 when you become a member for$200. When making your continuity offer, anchor the bonuses first, sell them the benefits of the amazing bonus, \\[...0.4s\\] not your continuity offer the bonus, \\[...0.6s\\] then use your high value bonus as an anchor.It may shock them, and that's okay, \\[...0.5s\\] because then when you ask, do you wanna know how you can get this free? If they do, which they will explain how become a VIP member today and you get it all as a free gift for joining, or you can just buy it for x very big number. Which would you prefer?More bonuses get more people to join. After you ask them if they want to know how to get it for free. You tell them they can get it when they join. Then you say, on top of that, when you become a member you'll get amazing thing 1, amazing thing 2, and amazing Thing 3\\. Mention the individual dollar values of each to anchor the value. Stacking bonuses this way gets more people to join your community.Making bonuses available only to those who join. If you want to force everyone into continuity, then offer continuity as the only option. In other words, make the bonuses only available if they join the membership. \\[...1.1s\\]Pricing for continuity versus upfront cash. For whatever reason, some people pick one time payments over continuity, even with higher one time payments, so offer a higher one time payment option.This way, some customers will make you more money today, while others stack recurring revenue for you tomorrow. We change the price depending on our goals. I've tested this a ton, at least for me, the data on this range looks clear.Check it out. To get 50%, to choose continuity, make your standalone offer \\[...0.5s\\] 1.33 times more. Example: \\[...0.4s\\] 3\\. 99 standalone offer is 2\\. 66 a month or 1\\. 99 per month membership. \\[...1.1s\\] To get 60%, to choose continuity, make the standalone offer 1.66 times more.Example 4: 99 standalone offer, which is 3\\. 33 a month or the 1\\. 99 membership. To get 70%, to choose continuity, make the standalone offer two times more.Example: 600 dollar standalone is three hundred ninety nine dollars a month or one 99 per month membership. To get 80% to choose continuity, make the standalone offer 2.33 times more. Example 6: 99 standalone membership, which is 4\\. 66 a month or 1.99 per month as a membership. To get 90% to choose continuity, make the standalone offer 2.66 times more. That's 7\\. 99 as a standalone offer, which is 5\\. 32 a month or 1\\. 99 a month if you become a member.I got these members from testing a lot of different stantolon offers versus continuity pricing across thousands of gems. \\[...1.7s\\] You may have to figure this out for yourself with your own pricing.The exact numbers matter less than the principle. The smaller the standalone price compared to the continuity price, the more people buy the standalone.The larger the standalone price compared to the continuity, the more people choose continuity. If you want more cash upfront, \\[...0.4s\\] make bonuses and Continuity Plus bonuses separate offers. Make the bonus only offer a single payment.That's 33 to 266% more expensive than the first month of Continuity Plus bonus offer. The bigger the price difference, the fewer standalone purchases you'll have, but the more money you'll make up front from each.Based on the day I just shared, people pay 33% more to avoid continuity. In other words, even if you charge 33% more for a one time purchase, half will buy it. If you want even more cash, offer bulk prepaid discounts, bulk on duty up sales, boost 30 day profits by a lot. Let's see you offer by 5 months get one free.Only one out of every 8 people have to take that up sale to raise 30 day profits by 50% that can make her break her money bottle. Note \\[...0.6s\\] laws of discounting apply, the larger the discount, the more people will take it.If you want commitments, you can pair the bonus with a commitment. For example, only allow customers to get the bonus if they join and commit for three, six or 12 months. Plus \\[...0.5s\\] you'll get more people to commit this way, but few will take it.At least compared to giving it to everyone \\[...0.4s\\] in the beginning, keep it simple. Just offer bonuses standalone and continuity month to month summary points.When it comes down to it, offering real discounts and then falling with your valuable free bonuses makes people excited about your offer. Then if they agree to your continuity offer, you can further upsell blocks of time to boost your 30 profits even more.With continuity bonuses, you give the customer an awesome thing if they sign up today.Typically the bonus itself has more value than the first continuity payment. If you use continuity as an attraction offer, advertise what you give away, not what you sell. Make your bonus related to your core offer so you engage the right leads. If possible, make your bonuses stuff you already have in due.This way you don't need to change your business or create new products. More people start continuity if you add more bonuses and discounts. To add bonuses, add more good stuff only if they sign up \\[...0.4s\\] to discount. Take away the cost of actual products, services, and features you sell. Sell the value of the bonus before telling them how they can get it for free. Offer bonuses as a standalone option for more cash up front.If you want half the people to take the standalone offer, price it 33% above your continuity \\[...0.9s\\] boost offering cash even more by offering a continuity to discount.

It looked like she wanted to make welcome to the neighborhood small talk.I hate small talk, but as I got closer, I got more interested. The art was perfect. A Ferrari took out the garage for spring cleaning, the patio table littered with cigarettes and beer. Kids, huh, \\[...0.4s\\] hi there, welcome to the neighborhood. Let me get the husband. I smiled through good teeth.Here we go. I'll came the character in backwards hat flip flops with a strong Midwest accent, speaking a mile minute \\[...0.4s\\] in the widest grin you've ever seen. \\[...1.2s\\] Hey, brother, man, nice to meet you. I can tell you're no doctor or lawyer living here so young.What kind of hustle you got? \\[...1.0s\\] He also got straight to the point relief. I told him a bit about my gyms, launching gyms, the rise of gym launch. He nodded with approval. He said he liked having another business owner on the street. What about you? I asked. He smirked. Trash? What trash?He saw my confused looking, continued, all right, see, see, \\[...0.7s\\] I knew for my time working trash, there wasn't much competition. Big commercial places and all went to the same place for the trash needs.So what you do? Well, I had a truck, took my credit card, and I gambled. I went to all the big apartments and said I do their trash for a whole year free if they contracted me to do the next 5 years paid. It worked good enough. They all made me their trash man before I knew it.Dang, I said \\[...0.6s\\] you fronted an entire year. Uh huh, and I'll tell you what it was the toughest thing I ever did. No one would invest in my business, not even my family. They all called me crazy.But after that one year Mark passed, the cash came flooding. I ate real fat then, and after a few years using that plan, I sold the whole shebang for pretty penny. Nice man, I never would have thought there was so much money in trash. There's cash and trash.Baby, what can I say? Oh, yeah, you want a beer or what? Needless to say, we stayed friends to this day.Listening to his success showed me the sheer power of a simple offer done right. That said, let's go over some important stuff, so you can make it work like he did. Also, if you think this looks like Bix get y free done cotton nudie style, then you'd be right.However, there are enough differences specific to continuity that it just divide its own chapter \\[...0.5s\\] description to make a one time continuity discount. You give products or services away for free if the customer commits to buying more products and services over time.This can attract loads of potential customers and make an easy sale anyone can close. If you look around, you'll see this offer in many different industries. It works. Think internet, pool cleaning, gym memberships, landscaping, and anything runable.I mentioned common ones, but you can make this work in any business so long as you know two things.First, how you apply the discount. I do it five ways, \\[...0.5s\\] and second, your cancellation policy because people don't always keep their commitments. Examples: \\[...0.4s\\] I discount in 4 ways up front, at the end, and even spread or after the first month or two.So let's walk through each. Up front, \\[...0.7s\\] you apply the discount up front and push out the term, as in the official time starts after their free time ends. This works best in industries who have successful history of enforcing contracts, cell phone, storage, real estate, equipment, or anything with collateral. Two notes.First, if you have historically high turn, then skip this one and consider the others.Second, \\[...0.4s\\] this does not get customers profitably. It gets customers but delays cash. So if you want more profitable options, continue on. \\[...2.3s\\]2. At the end, \\[...0.4s\\] you can apply the entire discount at the end and push out the term, so long as they make every payment on time, they get a bonus time equal to the value of the discount, they earn their free time.Third, spread over time. Apply the discount across the term. Say you give three months free for a one year commitment at$200 per month, you've discounted$600. By spreading that$600 over 12 months, they get a 600/ 12 months equals 50 dollar discount each month.You can also tell them that if they made all their payments on time, they can keep the discount for life after the term is over.4th way, \\[...0.5s\\] after the first or second payments, \\[...0.9s\\] they pay a few times, and then they get their one time discount. This way you collect a bit of cash to cover advertising and some delivery cost.I prefer to do it by presenting the offer as first and last or last month up front, \\[...0.4s\\] or adding some sort of activation fee before getting the bonus value. It ensures your customer use the valid form of payment.A small but important detail when you run a business. Important notes. Highest value per word note in this book, \\[...0.4s\\] skip this if you hate money. Bill weekly, \\[...0.6s\\] weekly, every two weeks, every 4 weeks, every 12 weeks, etc. Here's why \\[...0.5s\\] there are 12 months in a year, but the year has 13 four week cycles. That's an 8.3% difference.If I offer my thing at$100 every four weeks versus$100 a month, the same number of people will buy, but I make 8.3% more annually.To put this in perspective, if your business has 20% margins, this skyrockets annual profit by 41%. And the best part is you don't do any more work, just change a few words. What else can you do legally that makes so much money for solo to work? This has literally made me millions in pure profit, so, yeah, do it. Don't eat into the term with discounts, extend them.Let's say you offer 3 months free when you sign up for a year. That could mean they pay for 9 months, then get three free, so 12 months total. Or that could mean they pay 12 months and get 3 free 15 months total.I prefer with extending the term. Then I can feature down sell to a shorter one, \\[...1.1s\\] get 3% more revenue for 4 extra words.Yeah, it's X dollars plus a 3% processing fee. In my life, I've never had anyone not buy because of a processing fee, but 3% added to your top line for no extra work goes straight to your bottom line. If you run a 10% margin business and add 3%, you just added 30% to your profit worth it. And this works especially well when paired to \\[...0.8s\\] get two forms of payment.Recurring businesses lose mountains of cash because of payment processing problems.First, customers don't cancel, but their payment information changes or expires.Second, customers max out cards or have insufficient funds. We fix both issues with the same solution. I asked them if they want a 3% discount, a pretty standard processing fee. Do you wanna save the processing fee? Awesome.Give us a second form payment in case anything happens to the first one. If they ask why, which they rarely do, just say \\[...0.5s\\] we only have the processing fee because it costs us mid hours to get new information every month from our customers. So if you save us time, we pass the savings on to you. Get \\[...0.5s\\] ACH if you can.If you get a second form of payment, try to get ACH. \\[...1.1s\\] This is short for automated clearinghouse. This is a form of payment that links directly to their bank account. It's the cheapest way to transact besides cash.If you don't know what ACH is, look it up. Gift cards give the discount time in the form of a physical gift card. You can mail it to them if they're out of the area. The customer can apply the discount whenever they want after their first three payments or so.Then you can say, they can also give that to a friend if they want. And now you've got a lead magnet. Beyond that, many people simply forget to use it. In that instance, you just got a full price sign up.Nice. Try giving a lifetime discount at your most common turnpoint. You advertise the lifetime discount, but you make customers earn it. They get a lower rate if they stay past X period. Make X month your average customer drop off.Let's say, you know every customer stays four months on average. You tell everyone up front they get a lifetime discount after month 4\\. As the time approaches, tell them their new lower rate is right around the corner.Real world example. I saw a rice company selling a lot of rice. They offered three pricing options: \\[...0.5s\\] 1\\. A one time price, 2\\. A 5% off subscription, and 3\\. 15% off. If you stayed on subscription for five straight months, you earned the lifetime lower rate.I'm sure they figured out that that was just beyond where most people canceled \\[...1.0s\\] cancellations. You need to have a cancellation policy figured out ahead of time. There are many common ones, \\[...0.6s\\] 30 or 60 days notice, cancellation fees, cancel any time, etc.Since everyone comes into Mycont nudity offers on a discount of some kind. This is my favorite. Just make the cancellation fee equal to the discount they agreed to. So if they got$600 in discounts by committing, they can pay$600 whenever they want to cancel. This is very simple to explain. \\[...1.4s\\]Make sure customers know how to cancel. If customers have nowhere to complain inside your business, they will definitely complain outside of your business. If you have no obvious way for them to cancel, more people will vanish and complain.By having a clear way for them to contact you, then you can have a real chance to save it. Small businesses don't get rich by making stuff hard for their customers. If you make it easy, \\[...0.4s\\] you'll suffer fewer one star reviews and have a chance to save them when they do, because you'll know about it. If a customer wants to cancel, ask to do an exit interview.Some people like to vent. Let them get more angry about the problem than them. They may try to calm you down. Sometimes they'll save themselves. If they complain about something that you can solve by golly, solve it. If they wanted a better product, do a roll over up. Sell into higher level service if you have one to offer.I've had many people buy a lower cost offer, then complain because they wanted a higher cost feature. So I offer the higher cost feature and then they buy.Yes, it happens, and yes, it works. Use cancellation fees to the customer's advantage. I might say, I'll wait for cancellation fee if you come in and tell me what I could do better.This gives customer a real reason to give feedback. Then I can use their feedback to fix the problem or offer something better suited for them. At the very least, \\[...0.4s\\] they'll have nicer things to say about the business if I actually try to solve the problem.I routinely save a third to half of customers that agree to exit interviews. \\[...1.3s\\] Summary points: \\[...0.7s\\] continuity discount offers: give continuity time for free if the customer signs up today.Front loaded discounts convert more customers but may have higher turn. Back loading discounts convert fewer customers, but they have lower turn. Spraying the discount keeps cash flowing while providing the full discount. Use gift cards to give the discount to new customers and allow them to gift it to a friend or use it on themselves at a later date. You get a full price signup and a referral.Allow customers to earn a lifetime discount at your month of Greatest Churn to encourage customers to stick through it for a lifetime.Lower rate \\[...1.5s\\] lights: cancellation terms: get more people to sign up, but more people to leave. Harsher terms get fewer people to sign up, fewer to leave. I prefer customers cancel by paying the discount they got with their commitment. This puts them back to the month to month rate.Make sure customers know how to cancel. If a customer wants to cancel, ask for an exit interview. Incentivize them by saying you waive the cancellation fee if they do. You'll often be able to save or upsell them from the conversation. At the very least you'll understand what went wrong so you can do better. \\[...2.7s\\]Free gift \\[...0.4s\\] continuity discount offers, training like bonuses, discounts are only limited by your creativity.In this chapter, I give you the building box.

You can sign up month to month with a set up fee, or I'll waive it if you commit to a year. \\[...1.3s\\] January 2021: \\[...0.6s\\] for years I've heard stories about the legend, this high ticket sales guy.Today I finally got to meet him, but then it got weird. You'd think a man with a reputation like his would love working, but not him. In fact, his fuse about work nearly opposed mine. He aimed to work as little as possible, and those lifestyle guys tend to put me off. But he had his legendary reputation for a reason, so it made me all the more interested.I'd rather make a few million bucks a year with zero employees and cool customers than build some gigantic business that panders to anyone willing to give me a buck. He said, \\[...0.4s\\] I don't need to feed my ego. I just collect monthly payments and chill.Yeah, right, monthly payments. I was like, that sounds less chill than up front. Don't you have to deal with turn backouts and all the other houses of continuity? I said, \\[...0.8s\\] nope, not really. The way I sell is so simple you'll kick yourself once you hear it.You said, \\[...0.7s\\] I'm all ears. I tell customers they have two options. You can go month to month with a big setup fee. It covers the cost of getting you started, but you can leave whenever. Or if you commit to a year, I'll wave the fee \\[...0.7s\\] and I make the fee huge. So buyers commit to avoid it.I also have them initial, they understand they can quit early if they pay the fee I waived.Why such a big fee, I asked, it costs a lot to quit in the beginning, so that keeps them engaged, and I chimed in, \\[...0.9s\\] and once they pass that point, it cost about the same to cancel. So just to stick it out so they just stick it out bingo \\[...0.7s\\] description \\[...1.1s\\] waived fee offer works like this.First, you ask the customer to pay a startup fee as part of joining a month to month program.Typically I do 3 to 5 times by monthly rate. Then you offer to discount the entire fee if they commit to a longer term, but if they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee. Customers can choose to pay significant fee and keep the option to quit at any time, or they can commit the 12 months and get the fee waived. \\[...1.0s\\] Many will commit to avoid the big fee.We take a greater risk if they pay month to month, but they take a greater risk if they commit. If a customer chooses month to month, we lower our risk with the startup fee, but we lower their risk year to year by waving those fees.If they commit and want to quite early, then okay, they pay as if they had chosen month to month from the beginning.Very simple \\[...0.4s\\] bottom line. Customers will stay longer if leaving cost more than stay. \\[...1.1s\\] Example: \\[...0.4s\\] since the offer focuses more on pricing, it'll look the same in all continuity businesses. The following examples pulls from the story to give you a closer look at the mechanics. \\[...1.2s\\]Waived fees with commitment: \\[...0.5s\\] commitment length: 12 months, monthly rate: thousand dollars per month fee$5,000 if they pay month to month. So option A, pay one time fee of$5,000 plus$1,000 for the first month, then pay$1,000 per month thereafter, cancel whenever you want.Option B: waive the$5,000 if you commit to 12 months. Pay$1,000 per month, only pay the$5,000 if you break your commitment early. \\[...1.7s\\]Important notes, \\[...0.8s\\] fees get them to start. People give value out of comeding immediately because they avoid the fee. People want to avoid fees, so more people sign up to continuity mission accomplished \\[...0.6s\\] fees get them to stick. People will stick for the same reason they started \\[...0.4s\\] by sticking, they avoid the fee.People quit for millions of reasons, but incurring an additional and larger fee in order to cancel their original reason for quitting immediately shrinks compared to the value of avoiding the fee. In English, if the cost to quit exceeds the cost to stay, they'll probably stay \\[...1.3s\\] presenting the fee.Justify the fee by explaining the cost of taking on new customers for long term programs. Basically, if they want short term flexibility, they pay their own setup costs, but if they commit to staying long term, we pay their setup costs for them.If someone asks for additional reasoning, just say it costs us money to get you started. If you only wanna test this out, you cover those costs. If you commit to longer, I'll cover them.If more than 5% of people wanna cancel early, look into it. Pricing incentivizes stick, but can't and shouldn't overcome a terrible product.You wanna nudge them, not handcuff people into paying for something they hate. Then they'll just hate you. \\[...1.5s\\] If you want more cash up front, have a smaller fee. A smaller fee encourages people to go month to month. A larger fee encourages people to make the commitment \\[...0.5s\\]But if you need more cash up front, you can make the fee one and a/2 to three times the monthly rate. When you do this, more people will take it. It'll get more cash up front. Drop the fee after the customer fulfills the commitment.If someone stays the entirety their commitment, then wants to cancel, they have earned their free cancellation. It doesn't stick forever, this makes it equitable.I prefer this offer for commitments of 1 year and longer. The longer the commitment, the better this works. It works especially well with services that take a long time to work, think SEO, investing, weight loss, etc. It keeps people committed when they get emotional.Cancellation fees for a cause. \\[...1.2s\\] If you want to keep customers extra motivated, you can donate their fee to a cause that they are against example, what caused you absolutely hate, great, if you cancel early, I will be donating your set up fee to them. This gives them two reasons to stay.First, because they don't wanna shout the cash, second, because they don't want it to go to a cause they hate. Summary points.Waived fee offers present a month to month option with a fee or waive the fee if they commit. I typically make the fee three to five times my monthly rate at minimum. The commitment length should be a year. The larger your fee, the more buyers will offer the commitment.The smaller fee, the more upfront cash you'll get. If the customer meets the commitment, the fee officially goes away. \\[...1.2s\\]Free gift WAV fee video training \\[...0.4s\\] WAV fees are so, so, so effective.

Continuity offers provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing payments for until they cancel.Many businesses use continuity offers to attract customers for less, but it crashes. 30 day profits. This makes profitable advertising difficult.I use continuity offers differently. I make them last. I start with profitable attraction offers, then make my upselling downsaw offers. Then I offer continuity and if they accept, I upsell bulk payments of time or product at a discount.Then they automatically enter continuity after they've used up their bulk purchase. This way I make even more cash, and I get the recurring cash benefits of the other continuity customers. Continuity offers work with rewards or punishment.I prefer rewards and two of the three continuity offers I explained to use them, but there are always few times in a more traditional contract make sense.In those situation, I like wave fee offers. In the next section, we will create our hundred million dollar money model by combining all four offer types, attraction offers, upsell offers, downs offers and continuity offers.

Today \\[...0.5s\\] I accidentally discovered the gym launch licensing money model. I went from flying around and filling gyms to licensing the stuff I used.When I did it this way, gym owners could do it themselves. Looking back, it all started with a decoy offer. I attracted new customers with lots of free books, courses, video training, live training, and so on, all the stuff on growing a gym. Each product came with its own free call to help gym owners use it on the call.I'd offer a decoy offer. Now that you've got the plan, you could do it on your own for free or the premium offer. We can help you implement all the stuff for$16,000 over 16 weeks. If they took the premium offer, they'd get a treasure trove of money.Making tactics, tactics that took me years to figure out. People bought left and right and whoosh\\! My decoy offer took me to$476,000 per month and three months, not a typo. But I had a problem.Since I only had one thing to sell, I knew my revenue would plateau fast. I needed an upsell to raise profits or gym owners would stagnate. So I crafted an upsell offer for \\[...0.4s\\] the more advanced gym owners. I called it Gym Wards and priced it at$42,000 per year. I used the classic upsell to offer advanced playbooks and services and a community share brush practices as a continuity bonus. I started by offering a hefty 6,000 dollar discount for anyone who prepaid.Many gym owners paid up front with the money that I had just made them. For the ones who didn't, I offered a payment plan down. So \\[...0.4s\\] if they said no, I went with 10,000 down and spread the rest over time. If they said no again, I'd go for$800 a week, spread over 52 weeks. If they said no again, I said they could start for free.I'd use a continuity discount to frontload the free time for as long as it took them to finish off the first offer. Then they'd roll right into my continuity for the upsell.This way, their payments stay continuous and zoom the classic up sell plus continuity bonus plus payment plan, down sell plus continuity discount took me to 1.5 million a month. I had another thing to sell, woo, \\[...0.8s\\] and it exploded Jim watches money model to the next level, but I still had work to do.Even though the UPS and downs our process worked well, some gym owners kept saying no.So I went back to the drawing board. I came up with a more personalized menu upsell with different levels of service \\[...0.5s\\] offered, done for you advertising, done for you sales training offered turn key campaigns that made quick cash, and finally offered a minimum package continuous access to the original gym launch materials with tech support for a discounted monthly rate.If they didn't want the whole package, I used feature down cells to find the best option for them. Almost everyone stayed for something, \\[...0.6s\\] and wham menu up cells plus feature down cells took me to$2.3 million per month, all within 14 months.Then we started Prestige Labs and integrated it with Jim Lodge, a totally different business with its own money model. By month 20, we were raking in$4.4 million per month. It was life changing, and it only took a few darn good products and a hundred billion dollar money model to do it.Author note: when I started, I didn't know any of this money model stuff. It only looks clean looking back, but I hope this simplifies things so you take much less time than it took me.Description: \\[...0.6s\\] a money model is a deliberate sequence of offers. It's what you offer, when you offer, and how you offer it to make as much money as you can, as fast as you can. Ideally to make enough money from one customer to get in service at least two more customers in less than 30 days. And it rarely looks clean. But I break 100 million dollar money malls into three stages.Stage one, \\[...0.5s\\] get cash. Attraction offers, get more customers for less. Stage 2: get more cash upselling downsell offers, make more money from them faster. Stage 3: get the most cash continuity offers, maximize their total money spent.I break my 100 million dollar money model down in these stages because money model growth happens alongside the growth of a business. In other words, if you try to start a boost drive business from zero on your own with a finished money model, it will collapse on top of you.In fact, none of my business is started with a fully forced money model. They all start at stage 1, \\[...0.4s\\] even acquisition.com. In my experience, money models evolve like this: first I get customers reliably, then I make sure they pay for themselves reliably, then I make sure they pay for other customers reliably, then I start maximizing each customer's long term value.Then I spend as many advertising dollars as I can to print as much money as possible. My money models develop this way because I make sure each stage pays for the next. We keep improving each stage until it gets reliable. Also, this means financial and operational reliability.So fair warning. When your money model starts working, your business starts breaking part of the game. So I suggest you find someone who can build and lead the team to make your vision a reality. When I did, I married her. I hope the same luck finds you.Author note: I wanna make myself abundantly clear. Lots of 1 hundred million dollar money malls exist.Dare I say a hundred million dollar money mall exists for every hundred million dollar business. Remember, plenty of businesses make gobs of money in plenty of ways. I just show the ways that I've actually done it. \\[...1.3s\\]Example money models \\[...0.4s\\] gym launch money model breakdown services.

Pay 2\\. 97 now and keep that rate for life.Author note: I love this offer, it's nasty. It combines free trial, pay less now, pay more later, lifetime discount, and is an attraction offer and upsell offer and a continuity offer, a 6 headed money making monster. This is just a taste of how creative you can get by combining these.And finally, \\[...0.5s\\] example 4: \\[...0.6s\\] dog food physical product. Stage 1: attraction offer: buy X get y free, buy 4 months of food get 2 months free.Stage 2: up sale offer the classic up sale, just like the run across story. Do you want monthly? Do you want dog toys? How about dog vitamins? Stage 3: down, so offer feature down, so \\[...0.4s\\] just a premium food, then you don't want anything else, do you?Stage 3: continuity offer, automatic renew after the first bulk purchase. After 6 months, it continues to month a month, cancel anytime. Bingo, bingo.Make your own money model. \\[...1.3s\\] Step 1: \\[...0.4s\\] start with an attraction offer. The goal is to turn strangers into customers and cover our costs. So figure out what you're going to sell, then figure out the best way to present it. The attraction offer has my top favorites. When your money back giveaways decoy offers, buy X get y free, pay less now or pay more later, then advertise it.If you get leads who turn into customers, you're on your way figuring out what works best, may take up to a year. If you wanna learn more about advertising, make sure to check out my second book, 100 million Dollar leads.Step 2: pick an upsell offer. The goal is to get 30 day profits well above are cost of getting a customer and delivering what you offer them. Remember, once you solve a problem, another appears. Those problems also need solutions. You solve the problems your attraction offer creates with upsell offers.So pick the upsell offer that best matches the problem you solve and how you solve it.The up sell offer section gives you my four favorites, the classic up sell menu, up sell, anchor, up sell, roll over up sell, then you make your offer at their time of greatest need, \\[...0.4s\\] and remember, make your offer at their time of greatest need.Step 3: pick a down sell offer. The goal is to get customers who said no to your last offer to say yes to another offer. This way, you sell way more people than you otherwise would. So you make more total cash from the same number of leads.The down so offer section shows you my three favorites. If you wanna keep your price the same, change how they pay with payment planned downsells or trials. If you wanna charge less, change what they get with feature downsells.And best of all, you can alternate between them in the same sale. The more flexible you make your offers, the more people will buy them. \\[...1.2s\\] Step 4: \\[...0.4s\\] pick a continuity offer.The goal here is to get one last sale on our 30 day window and stack recurring cash. So I try to include continuity in every business eventually. My three favorites are \\[...0.7s\\] continuity bonuses, continuity discounts, and Wade fee offers.Sometimes the best timing for continuity offers happens after the first 30 days, and that's okay. It's better to make the offer at the right time than to try and force it at the wrong time.Author note: for bootstrap businesses, \\[...0.4s\\] you have to get customers out of profit unless you get outside investors, start with a fortune or have an endless source free customers.Achieving a money model is the only way you can profitably scale. Otherwise you run out of cash and go out of business before you even have a shot. Important notes: \\[...0.6s\\] perfect one offer at a time.It's tempting to implement a whole money model at once. Don't stick to your stage. Pick one offer, try it, keep doing it until it works reliably, and after it's reliable, do it so many times, it gets automatic, then go to the next stage.Patience is still the fastest way to get to your goal, so you'll need to measure in quarters, not weeks. You either build it right, or you build it again and again and again, building again, no matter how fast, still takes longer than building right the first time.I know that one from experience. \\[...1.1s\\] Raise prices in stages. Make new offers cheap at first, then as you get yeses, raise the price. Lots of early yeses, get customer feedback and make the product better.Then as the offer gets reliable, start raising the price, and keep raising the price until the extra cash from the yeses doesn't make up for the nos, \\[...0.7s\\] simple scales, fancy fails. Get as much as you can out of what you have.Remember, it's less about having 100 products to offer, and more about having 100 ways to offer your product. Think more ways to sell the same thing, not more things to sell. If I offer personal training, I can offer 1, 2, 3, 4 sessions per week.This turns one product into many offers. Important \\[...0.5s\\] affiliate products can fill money model gaps, and affiliate relationship just means you sell other people stuff for a commission. If you don't have anything to offer and wanna start a business, you can offer somebody else's stuff.If you have a single offer and wanna add more offers to your money model, you can also offer somebody else's stuff.If you have 100 million dollar business and wanna make more money without adding operational headache, you can offer somebody else's stuff too. In short, you can always offer somebody else's stuff in your money model.Here's a few examples \\[...0.6s\\] service: \\[...0.5s\\] a dental agency sends their dentist clients to a braces manufacturer.The manufacturer sends them a commission \\[...0.5s\\] for each dentist they sent. More money, no extra work, voila. Local business: massage therapist sells clients somebody else's home massage tools, exercise pads, medicine balls, etc. The customer pays through the therapist and the other company ships it directly to them. A few extra words, a lot extra money, no extra service delivered.Digital product: an educator tells his clients to use a specific customer service software. The software company sends the consultant a commission for every sign up. \\[...1.5s\\]Turn attraction offers into continuity offers with automatic renewal. This makes a two for one. For example, if you do a buy 6 months get 6 months free offer, they can automatically roll into a month of month subscription at the end of 12 months.This gets the benefit of attraction in continuity offers, both a small tip with big implications. You can mix and match offers however you want.I present offers this way because it's how I use them. But if you recall, I Learned many of them from people use them differently than me. Many of these offers you can use anywhere. You can use upsell tactics in your attraction offer, you can install a downsell process with every offer. You can use a continuity offer to attract new customers.There are no rules. You can do whatever you want. I show you stuff one way, but I fully expect you to use it in another. So start with the way I suggest it, then as you get better, experiment. It's how I learn the stuff and how you learn it too.Summary: \\[...0.6s\\] a money model is a deliberate sequence of offers. Money models have three stages: get cash, attraction offers, get more cash, up sales and down sales.Get the most cash continuity offers. To make your own money model, start an attraction offer, once you get your customers in cash, add an upsell offer. From there, add downsell offers to get even more people to buy, then finally add your continuity offer.Do not try and implement a full money model at once. It will break your business.It's less about having 100 products to offer and more about having a hundred ways to offer your product. To sell more stuff without starting a hundred businesses. Offer stuff from other businesses and let them deliver it.Affiliate relationships can fill the gap in your money model without the headache of delivery.Price new offers low enough that you will get lots of yeses. Use customer feedback to improve your product, then start raising the price until you stop making more money. A 100 million dollar money model eliminates cash as a bottleneck for growth.

A good money model makes more profit from a customer than it cost to get and service them in the first 30 days. That's the bare minimum. 3.A 100 million dollar money model makes more profit from one customer than it cost to get and service many customers in the first 30 days, which removes cash as a limiter to scaling your business.4. Money models have four types of offers: attraction offers, upsell offers, downsell offers, and continuity offers. Five attraction offers get customers by offering something free or at a discount. Often they also make money by offering a better deal at a higher price.We covered five: \\[...0.8s\\] a. When your money back, you set a goal for the customer and tell them how to reach it. If they reach it, and they qualify to get their money back or get it back in store credit. Be giveaways: \\[...0.5s\\] you advertise a chance to win a big prize in exchange for contact information in anything else you want.After picking a winner, you offer everyone else the big prize at a discounted price.C. Decoy offers: \\[...0.4s\\] you advertise a free or discount offer when lead asked to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium offer. The premium offer includes more features, benefits, bonuses, guarantees, and so on.D. Buy X, get y free: you offer customers free stuff in exchange for buying other stuff for money.The more free stuff and the higher its value, the more people buy. E. Pay less now or pay more later. You give people a choice to pay full price later or pay a discounted price now and get additional bonuses. \\[...2.1s\\]Upsell offers \\[...0.4s\\] are whatever you offer next, typically more, better or newer versions of what they just bought. These get you more cash fast.We covered. 4A. The classic upsell. You offer a solution to the customer's next problem the moment they become aware of it. You can't have X without y \\[...0.7s\\] b. Menu up sells. You tell customers which options they don't need, then tell them which they do and how to get their value from it. You don't need that, you need this. C.Anchor up sells. You offer your most expensive thing first. If the customer bulks, you offer a much cheaper and still acceptable alternative. No worries, if you don't care about X, this may be a better fit for you.D. Rollover up sells: you credit some or all of the customers previous purchases towards your next offer. Since you already spent$500, I'll just credit that towards staying for a full year. \\[...1.3s\\]7. Down cell offers \\[...0.6s\\] are whatever you offer after someone says no, and by turning Nos into yeses, you make more money. We covered three, \\[...0.5s\\] a payment plan down cells. You offer the same product at the same price, but they pay some now and the rest over time. When do you get paid?Let's do half now and half then. \\[...1.0s\\] B, \\[...0.4s\\] draw with penalty. You let customers try your product or service for free so long as they meet your terms. If they do, they have a better chance of becoming paying customers. If they don't, they pay.If you do X, y and Z, I'll let you start for free. See, feed your down cells. You lower prices by changing what the customer gets. I offer lower quantity, lower quality, lower price alternatives or cut optional components entirely. If you're okay with that, a guarantee I can knock off 400 bucks.8. Continuity offers provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing payments for until they cancel. These boost the profit of every customer and give you one last thing to sell.We covered 3\\. A continuity bonus offers, you give the customer an awesome thing if they sign up today. Typically the bonus itself has more value than the first continuity payment.If you sign up today, you also get \\[...0.4s\\] XYZ valuable thing. B. Continuity discount offers: you give the customer free time an hour later if they sign up today. C. Waves fee offers.First you ask the customer pay a starter fee as part of joining a month to month program. Then you offer to discount the entire fee if they commit to longer term. If they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee. 9.You build money models one stage at a time. Once I get customers reliably, then I make sure they pay for themselves reliably, then I make sure they pay for other customers reliably, then I start maximizing each customer's long term value. Then I print as much money as I can.Ottoman \\[...0.4s\\] the knowledge in these bullets brought me more free and profitable customers than I've known what to do with. If executed, they will do the same for you, and with that cash will no longer constrain your business. I hope this book helps you grow your dream as big as you done.Well, please. Also, since you are one of the few who actually finish what you start, I want to leave you with a parting gift. Some closing remarks that got me through hard times. \\[...1.1s\\]Final thoughts. You don't become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror. You become confident by giving yourself a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are. Out work yourself doubt. \\[...1.9s\\] This is an actual post I made on July 25th, 2020 before I made my life public.The image contrasts where I used to sleep on the floor seven years earlier with me on a private chat.

They turn advertising into money by offering something free or at a discount.We do this because everyone wants a great deal. In a great deal, customers get far more value than the price they pay. Strangers can only take your word on the value, but they actually understand the price. For that reason, discounts make anything a great deal to just about anyone. And the greater the discount, the better the deal. So the greatest discount of all being free, so free to discount continue.This is a visual representation of what I alluded to earlier, but 100% off \\[...0.7s\\] versus 0% off. So this is free, this is \\[...0.5s\\] full price, and then this is the also lowest demand when you have full price versus highest demand which is free.So the more you move this way, the higher the demand. The more you have, you give off pretty much. That's how it works the lineup.So this is the lineup, these are the plays that I'm going to explain to you. We've at our win your money back giveaways, decoy offer, buy X get y free, \\[...0.4s\\] pay less now or pay more later, and then free with conception. This one is not in the book FYI.So with that being said, \\[...0.6s\\] let us begin. \\[...1.9s\\] So we start with our very first money model in the book, which is an attraction offer when your money back, so when your money back is one of these incredibly sexy offers that I start with, because it's made me more money than any other offer than I'm going to show you.Let's dive in. We're gonna go through how I Learned it, the description, the examples, important points and summary.Alright, so this is my beautiful doodle \\[...0.8s\\] that exemplifies what this is. So I was in this gym mastermind, where I signed up before I had a gym. Because I wanna learn about the gym business. And this guy Danny, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, said he had a client, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, say no, \\[...0.5s\\] and then said, well, \\[...0.4s\\] I'll pay you 500 bucks, and you can train me 1:01, and if I lose 20 pounds in eight weeks, \\[...0.5s\\] um, you give me the money back, but I'll let you use my, you know, my pictures.And so, you know, Danny was like, well, I'd rather take the money than not take the money. And so he did the deal.The dude got amazing results, and the thing is that once the guy got amazing results, he advertised the before and after of this dude, and he got like 13 more customers from advertising this guy's results. And so he starts talking about that at this mastermind.We then took it at the gym that I was at with Sam, and we tried a six week version of it to shorten it.It was still one on 1 PT personal training. And so then I had the idea \\[...0.5s\\] of, hey, 1\\. Let's see if we run ads for this instead of just being like, a thing that we tell our customers, and 2\\. What if we made it large group instead of personal training?And so those two changes \\[...0.4s\\] took this from this is a profitable thing to this being a money nuclear bomb. And so \\[...0.7s\\] we then switched it to free and non free versions with credit back and money back guarantees, which I'll explain in more detail.Alright, so that's how I Learned it. It was an iteration. I mean, this was like a year, two years before we Learned every single thing that I'm gonna share with you in like eight or 10 minutes. So now that's how I Learned it.Let's go into the description. Alright, what is this thing even mean? So a win your money back offer works like this. So you set a goal for your customer, and then you tell them how to reach it. And if they reach it, then they qualify to get their money back or get it back as store credit. And so there's \\[...0.4s\\] kind of three versions of this.So version one is you just they bet that they're gonna get results, they bet that they're gonna take a certain set of actions, or they bet that they're gonna do a combination of both.And so \\[...0.7s\\] let's walk through each of them, so with results, \\[...0.5s\\] no matter what they do, if the customer gets the result, then they win the money back.So for example, making X dollars a month, getting why customers losing Z pounds or losing 20 pounds. You can starve yourself not shoved anything, but if you lose 20 pounds, you get the money back. Right? Basically they bet on their ability to just reach the goal.The second version of this is that you hold them accountable to doing actions instead of getting results. So no matter what results they get, if the customer does what you tell them to, then they qualify to win their money back.So for example, \\[...0.4s\\] they attend all sessions, calls, meetings, they long progress, they take pictures, they do assigned homework, they bet on their ability to follow directions. That's the bet \\[...0.7s\\] or you do both is that they have to both follow your directions \\[...0.3s\\] and they have to get the goal.Now the thing with both is often times a customer doesn't have the skill to reach the goal, which is why giving them the directions and tying them both together can be important to getting them the best results possible as an aside.You wanna tie the actions that you require them to do to qualify for the refund \\[...0.4s\\] with the actions that do two things, 1, that advertise your business, and 2 that get them best results. \\[...1.2s\\]Alright, so \\[...0.9s\\] what ends up happening with the win your money back offer is that it becomes a high cash, low choreographed onboarding. So if you currently onboard customers, then you're not getting paid for it.It's a cost to your business, \\[...0.3s\\] and so I would rather make it a revenue generator for my business. And so the nice thing is that it works even for people who don't come in for free offers. So this offer works so well when people came in just cause the referrals and whatnot.I still gave them this offer because people got better results there, more invested newest fund. And so we got better results out of this than any other program. And so a lot of people think that we made the money on the people who didn't hit the goal couldn't be further from the truth.The people you didn't hit the goal a lot of times, it wouldn't necessarily wanna become customers.We had 78% success rates \\[...0.6s\\] of people hitting their goal. The magic was \\[...0.6s\\] again, I didn't wait till the end of their program. Anyways, I would be selling them up, selling them at three weeks into their six week thing. And so I'd say, hey, you're down 12 pounds.If you lose eight more, you're gonna be happy forever. They would be like, no, you're like, okay, well, you wanna lose 50, right? They're like, yeah, I'm like okay, well, \\[...0.6s\\] so you realize it's not about these six weeks.They say something great, then you won the challenge as far as I'm concerned. Cause you realize it's about a lifestyle change, not a six week, you know, weight loss thing.I just use that to get you in, but I really want is for you to make this big change, and so if you're good with it, what I wanna do is take this money, \\[...0.4s\\] and I wanna give it to you back to you as though you've already won. And let's just credit towards the main goal you have.And so by doing that, we could take the short term goal and flip it into the long term goal. \\[...1.7s\\] And so this particular model of acquisition, this offer, \\[...0.4s\\] um, works well with businesses that require customers to do a lot in order to be successful.And so there's some businesses where, like, you work on the roof of the, of the house, \\[...0.4s\\] the house gets fixed.There's really not a lot for the customer to do there. So the win your money back, \\[...0.4s\\] not the right money model for that if you have a business where someone has to take action in order to see results, this is very common in service businesses, sometimes even its offer businesses.They need to honor themselves, need to put their information, put their profile picture up.Whatever it is, \\[...0.5s\\] this structure murders, \\[...0.4s\\] and so the bottom line is customers put money down if they do the stuff where they get the result or both. They get it back as cash or store credit. That's how this works. \\[...1.4s\\]So \\[...0.6s\\] let's give some examples here. So if you have a rehab facility, it would be, like, \\[...0.4s\\] the free kick that habit in 28 day blueprint or free kick that habit \\[...0.4s\\] insert word, \\[...0.6s\\] the suggestion \\[...0.6s\\] attend all your rehab sessions, post in the group once a week, journal daily in our app, attend your feedback session in your transformation session, which are both sales and up sale opportunities.So earlier I said \\[...0.9s\\] you want the actions they have to take to be things, they get the results or things to advertise your business.The third category is sales appointments, and so you want it to be mandatory that they attend the upsell opportunities that you have.So remember earlier I showed the five different places, then you make each of those places that they must attend. \\[...1.5s\\] And so the result maybe for these might be like pass a urine test at the end in 28 days, that's the result, like if they're clean, awesome.Right? And so this would just be a pure results base thing. Okay, you could add in these pieces to make it action and results.Let's say in a pain relief business, so 28 day 1, 0\\. 1 pain relief program. Fine, \\[...0.6s\\] commitment is that you attend all your rehab sessions, do your at home stretches, post a picture in the group once a week. When you're done, attend your feedback session and transformation session.Very similar, but now it's just about them doing that, and not at all about having the pain relief, because this is one that's a little bit more subjective, so might be \\[...0.7s\\] unfortunately, people are \\[...0.9s\\] not always ethical when it comes to their own money. And so we say okay, them saying why went for it? I'm still a 10 out of 10 paying, and please give me my money back.So this way, if you have them do all the stuff that becomes the, the requirement for earning the money back. Example marketing, so let's say you, uh, you teach me a lot of market.You say okay, free five clients, a five day challenge. Uh, the action you have to take is you have to send 100 outbound messages per day, attend the daily training, post in the group.Uh, once you've done your homework, and the results is make five closes, and the goal is that you have to make five sales, and you have to send the DMS, and if you do both, you get the thing back cash back right now, you're like, how does the free thing work?I'll explain how you can do free with money down \\[...1.8s\\] important points. So when your money back works with new current and previous customers, so \\[...0.4s\\] somebody who's new can come in and take this offer. You can just offer to your existing customer base, cause that a lot of them get really interested in it. Uh, you can use it with past customers.It works for any type of customer. Uh, it works well with people that, that start and quit stuff or services where people are required to do a lot of work. The key is that you have to have something else to offer on the back end that they could take that cash and credit towards.Alright, so that$500 or whatever amount of money you wanna charge for the thing. You then should have something that's five times more expensive on the back end, so that they get a 20% discount on that by crediting it forward.Now if you know that you're gonna be giving a 20% discount, guess what you can do to your back in price if everyone comes in on?When your money back, you can raise it by 20% if every person comes in on that. If people don't commit on that, then that gets more difficult. And so the reason that I even people who came in for a view referral, I still put on the win your money back is cause I knew my pricing and everything else was dictated off of this 500 dollar credit I knew I was gonna give them. \\[...1.4s\\]If you don't like the idea of giving cash back, you can also \\[...0.4s\\] advertise it as store credits. You, once you get it, you can credit it forward. And so that does create, I would say, a longer term customer. Um, it makes the free part different.And let me explain \\[...0.4s\\] the way that I made it legally free, at least within the laws of the United States based on the council that I had was that I had an unconditional money back guarantee.And so that was actually more important for me advertising free than the whole getting the money back. All of that stuff it turns out at least from the letter of the law based on the people that I spoke with. And \\[...0.6s\\] big, big big big big, you really \\[...0.4s\\] risk \\[...0.4s\\] getting in trouble when you have upset customers.And so why my first rule of staying out of trouble is give someone their money back if they ask for it? It's \\[...0.4s\\] not worth the risk. It's also just not worth the headache. Just give it back, go get another customer. That's it. Alright, so I say don't take blood money, \\[...0.3s\\] give refunds if they asked for it.But the unconditional guarantee basically gave me two different types of kind of guarantees. One was performance based. If you do the stuff, I'll give you the money back.But I also said I have a service guarantee, which is that if for any reason by the end of this six weeks, you don't delete, believe that I gave you$500 of service. I'll give you the money back even if you're at \\[...0.4s\\] day 41 and 23 hours.And the thing is that closed a lot of people because they're like, okay, I was like, listen, the goal, like I wanna get you to stay long term, so if you don't think that the service is worth, you're not gonna stay anyways. And so that made a lot of sense for people and they're like, cool.So \\[...0.6s\\] from a selling perspective, ask them if they want short or long term goals, and you sell this as the kick start to a long term thing. And so you explain the benefit of giving external motivation to teach internal motivation.Alright, these are all very vague and amorphous words, but in terms of selling, very effective. And so I would say, hey, \\[...0.6s\\] when you were a kid, you probably had to have your mom say, hey, you gotta go brush your teeth, Timmy. And \\[...0.4s\\] you go there and you brush your teeth, right?And now that you're an adult, \\[...0.5s\\] do you brush your teeth? And they're like, yes, it's like that's an example of something external being the reason for you doing an action until eventually the internal engine kicks off.That was my analogy. It's like so that's exactly what we're gonna use this money for in the beginning to create a new habit.Now our thing was six weeks, you probably heard 21 days to make a new habit. We double that leg so that you can make this new habit you stick with. We use the extra to get you going. The intern will keep you going, \\[...0.5s\\] right.And so that's the toothbrush story, create habits that don't take effort. And that's what we try to build with these types of money models. And so as an aside when crediting the people, uh, on the back rolled into service over an extended period of time.So this is a pro tip, so for example,$600, \\[...0.4s\\] I wouldn't say great, now you have three months free. That didn't work. I did that for a year and it almost killed me. Instead take the$600 and extend it over the year. So you say great, so we're gonna sign out for this year long membership. That's me.20, four hundred dollars is$200 a month. Take the 600 dollars off, now it's 18 dollars. Reverse it back out.So you're basically saving 50 dollars a month \\[...0.3s\\] by using 50 dollars for that 600 dollar credit for the whole year. And by doing that, I, basically I got the cash up front, \\[...1.4s\\] and then they paid me again.How to create your win your money back criteria, so this is key, so these criteria make or break the offer, and so good criteria have these characteristics. No. 1 is they're easy to track, so you wanna train them on exactly what they need to do, or they will mess up.Alright, bonus points if people already do it. For example, phones already track steps, that's something that if, like, if you can use that, then that would be an easy thing that they already do. Word processors, for example, already track word count.Uh, cameras automatically date photos, so these are all things that already occur, and so the more magical you can make the tracking, the easier it is for them.The second thing is that you want customers to track stuff that is likely to get them results and realistic criteria do just that. So if you think the criteria look too easy, \\[...0.3s\\] you've probably got closer realistic.Alright, they may take a few times to get right, but so does anything worth doing. Alright, so for example, it could be, you know attend meetings, workouts, watch videos, etc. Just whatever the stuff the best customers do to get the results, make everyone do it on purpose.So this is the process. You do this in the beginning and have no idea. You then find people get results, you look at what they did, then you say everybody has to do the stuff that the best people did. And then you do it again. You look at the people who did the best results of that stuff.You say, great, everybody has to do that stuff. And you look for the common factors of the fewest things they all did, not everything they all did.And the third is advertising the business. And I'll have two parts of this. So one is advertising publicly. The other is you basically selling, uh, being able to sell them. Alright, so \\[...0.5s\\] I like using this as criteria. So that means that like when you work out at my gym you have to post it publicly.Now that means that if every person's working out three times a week over six weeks, I'm gonna get 18 free \\[...0.4s\\] organic posts from 100 people. I'm gonna get 18 organic posts in a tiny market, all saying the same words that I told them to say with a link to our thing. And guess what would happen? We got more customers and at the end, what would they have to do?Post a picture of the before and after. And then when they post a picture before and after, guess what? That did brought more customers and guess what?That also did more people would comment on all their posts. And they had to tag me in it. And so I could have all of these leads across all these comments of all these people who liked and said, that's amazing what Jim is that whatever.So they tag me, they tag my business, and then they had the copy that they had to follow for the structure for those posts. Again, you're going to give them their money back, \\[...0.6s\\] so you can have some stuff that's in it for you.And this kind of falls into the reason why you're like, why are you doing this \\[...0.5s\\] if you give all the money back? Cause again the person who's buying this should believe they're gonna get the money back, cause they believe they're gonna fall through.So, like, what, what's in it for you? And you're like, dude, i'mma get way more customers than you. Two things I want you to stay, and I want you to bring me friends. And if I get your results, you're gonna stay, and you're gonna bring me friends. That's how this works.The fourth piece here, which is, kind of, like, part 2 of the advertising is that you include the sales appointments, cause that's gonna allow you to get referrals, \\[...0.6s\\] get testimonies for the before and after pictures, and then obviously upsell your other levels service.So \\[...0.5s\\] here's how you \\[...0.6s\\] apply the store credit. This is important, so when customers \\[...0.4s\\] win their money back, offer to apply it over a longer period of time or a bulk package. So it doesn't like you can have them prepay for a year and have them take it off.I usually have stuff that's five times more expensive as the up sell off the front end that way. The max I give is like 20% off. Alright, that's if I didn't change my price, ideally like I said earlier, I bump it by 20%.In my experience, this keeps customers engaged and makes you more money. Because if you just give it free, I notice that people, \\[...0.7s\\] it's, \\[...0.8s\\] I hate the quote, but in this particular example, if people didn't pay for the membership, they stopped coming.If they just used off credit, and then when their first real Bill came, they'd be like, I'm good. But if they had to start paying even at a discount, they ended up coming they kept coming right.And that was the that was the thing that I found out, because if you have a business where it takes work for someone to do it, then it's like, you wanna have them have some skin in the game.And that was actually the term I used in the SAB, like, we need you to have some skin in the game, and I also told the story I just told.So we're like, why don't you do it up front? I'd be like, because honestly, when people I did up front, people didn't come, \\[...0.4s\\] and you wanna you want this to work I want this to work for you, so I'm happy to give you the discount, and plus you're still gonna get this money.Uh, we're just gonna put over for a long period of time so that you stick with this, cause that's what you write, that's what you want, right?Okay, cool. Um, now someone's like, well, I want the free time and I'm definitely gonna stay. That's like, cool, then sign up for here, \\[...0.4s\\] like, if you know you're gonna stay, then don't worry about it's not free.I'll give you the first 3 months for free. This, how works math wise? So you have a product that costs, let's say,$200 a month. A customer wins$600 a credit to get, avoid giving them that stuff up front, instead apply the$600 over 12 months to 600/ 12 is 50 bucks a month. They now pay 200- 50, which is one 50 per month.Alright, so to be clear, they can use the credit however they want. It is up to them if you wanna be ethical and comply with advertising rules and promises, they can use it however they want. I recommend presenting this offer first, right, that way they can use it, and then I share the experience I just shared.Right. And so in depth details of the upsell offer \\[...0.4s\\] are actually in the rollover upsell, which is later in this training. So I'll just leave it at that, because this is more offer structure, the upsell stuff comes later.All right, so all meetings in quiet calls provide opportunities to make more offers. So make every single meeting that you have of the customer an opportunity \\[...0.7s\\] to present an offer.All right, and so make check in meetings part of your money back Critier whenever you can make all meetings required to win their money back. Part of that beyond helping them succeed, they're also the best opportunities to make offsell offers.So after you've checked in \\[...0.5s\\] offer what makes sense based on their feedback, and so these are the three appointments I had.So we had nutrition orientation which was our before pictures, and that's where I sold supplements. Then we had our progress check in which I made my membership offer, like, hey, commit to stay for the next year.Then I have my transformation \\[...0.4s\\] feedback which is their after meeting where I would get after pictures, and then I would make the membership offer again to anybody who hadn't already bought. And to the people who had bought, I offered them to prepay it. Here's another pro tip for you, make everybody a winner.Alright, so you know this. They don't know this, and I don't sell this upfront. You do not mention this in the first sale. The reason I made everyone a winner is that about halfway through, you make your next offer as though they already won.Alright, and so you lower the customer's anxiety about failing, and then you'll keep them longer. They'll also love you more. And so this is what I would say, hey, I know you're trying to hit the short term goal, but what's your long term goal?Okay, that's great to hear, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, you get that. This isn't about this program, but about your long term results. So I'll tell you what to show you how much I want you to hit that long term goal. I'll credit this program towards the other one, whether you hit their short, short term goal or not.How's that sound? So now I actually \\[...0.4s\\] get them to buy by reducing their risk of losing the money they agreed to risk. So I say you won the bet without having had having to win because you get the long term goal.So it's actually a risk reduction sale \\[...0.5s\\] if position properly. And so at the end of the program, let the losers win. So if someone refuses the upsell and then still fails the challenge, you can still upsell them again. And the way you do that is by acting like they won.So I would say something like this, I'd say don't worry about it, you started, that's the biggest victory of all, and even though you didn't hit your short term goal, you met ours. So here's the, even though you didn't hit your goal, you met my goal, \\[...0.4s\\] right, which was finishing what you started.Alright, so to show you that we're in this for the long haul. I'll credit your entire deposit towards staying with us long term that you still get your money back, you still hit your goal. How does that sound?And so now they're like, wow, these guys are great. And so no, the point was not to get people to fail. The point is get people to \\[...0.4s\\] succeed, get them to finish, get some momentum and then credit towards a longer term relationship.So those are the important points that feel like there's a little bit more context to how to make this work. Yes, alright, so quick summary. When your money back offer rocks, because you get loads of over cash, you get more customers to say yes than you would before.You get \\[...0.5s\\] massive amounts of results for customers, you get more long term customers, they advertise your offer for you, that gets you even more customers, and make the meetings apart of getting the deposit back, and get great results for them.And everyone thinks this business makes money based on the people fail the program. No, the real money is from the people who succeed with it, and you have something else to offer them. So trust me on this one, the more results you deliver, the more money will make.Think long, and so make the refund right here to easy to track, align with customer goals and help with the business. Only use it when your money back offer if your refund rate is less than 5%, otherwise you need to fix your products before doing this, cause you will risk getting too many refunds. I also added my unconditional guarantee to make sure that was super compliant.If anyone ever wanted the money back, I just gave it back to, \\[...0.5s\\] by the way, by me offering the unconditional, just to give you some context.Over 4000+ sales and five years, I gave two back \\[...0.5s\\] four unconditional \\[...0.9s\\] people winning and then wanted to take the winning and leave or whatever, like things like that.Sure, but people who said I didn't think I got the service, there was two and I shouldn't have sold those people. I like \\[...0.4s\\] arm wrestled them to get them to buy. Put the short credit towards another, preferably more expensive offer \\[...0.4s\\] that you want them to stay as customers, to give them the opportunity.You never want people to stop paying you. That's the key point of this whole offer and to make more sales and keep more customers, make everybody a winner.That way everyone stays surprised and grateful when you make your UPS offer. So now my UPS offer is this amazing thing that they're grateful for me making the offer rather than this other opportunity to sell them. That is the win your money back money. \\[...0.2s\\]"

    "content": "\\[...2.0s\\]So our next attraction offer is free giveaways, so I'm gonna go over how I Learned it, description, examples, important points in summary. So let's dive in, so how I Learned this. So I, I was talking to, um, a business owner, and he was telling me about this, you know, crazy play that he had that was working really, really well.And I was like, okay, well, how does it work? He said, so basically I give away a scholarship for my year long flagship thing, um, if people kind of opt in and they have to, you know, answer a couple questions about their business, why should pick them, etc.He said, so then I do, you know, a countdown, and then I do a drawing, \\[...0.4s\\] um, and I do a live webinar where I, you know, release it live, sell people on how great it is.And so after he, \\[...0.4s\\] he \\[...0.4s\\] told me, he's like, wait, so I pick the person. I was like, yeah, but okay, so you just give something away for free. Like, how does that, how does that actually \\[...1.0s\\] make you any money in the business? He said, well, the key is \\[...0.5s\\] the \\[...0.8s\\] participation trophy, or said differently, the partial scholarship.And so he's like, so what I do is I reach out to all the people who opted in \\[...0.5s\\] and filled out all these questions about why they should be eligible, their pain points, their aspirations, their dreams, why they should qualify, why this is important to them.He's like, and then I just do a second countdown for people who \\[...0.4s\\] have partial scholarships for them to basically redeem those. And that partial scholarship is a discount off of the \\[...0.4s\\] value that I advertise and \\[...0.8s\\] for my grand prize, right, of the full scholarship.And so that structure, I was like, oh, he said, here's the great part. I use the same structure that I give to the online fitness trainers so that they do the same thing when they get customers.So they just say, hey, I'm doing a one year transformation or whatever it is. And then they have a bunch of people opt in for it and they do partial scholarships for everybody else.And so this clearly became this repeatable framework of \\[...0.4s\\] grand prize \\[...0.6s\\] participation, trophy, your grand prize promotional offer.So you promote the main thing and then you give some sort of discount off the main thing for people who ask for \\[...0.4s\\] or are qualified for that main offer and said, this gives you an amazing way to generate tons of leads. It gives you a very cool way to ethically sell how amazing something is.Like if I, if I get up on stage and say, hey, I've got this amazing thing at target, how great it is.That's one thing. Now if everybody in the audience knows that they're waiting for me to pick one of them to win this thing, they are way more engaged, they're way more leaning in because they're imagining \\[...0.4s\\] them actually winning it.So you have kind of a different level of receptivity, which is what I think makes this so powerful. And you can also get a ton of goodwill cause you're like giving stuff away, right? So it's just, it's an awesome, awesome play.Now to be clear though, this is, \\[...0.4s\\] this is something that is so powerful that it is \\[...0.4s\\] illegally, \\[...0.4s\\] um, regulated.Alright, because if you do one of these and you charge for it, it's called an illegal lottery. Alright, and so, like, these things work well enough that the laws had to get made to, to show \\[...0.8s\\] how not to do them wrong way.Okay, so how does this work overall? So I'll just read this to you. So giveaway offers average has a chance to win a big prize in exchange for content information, whatever else you want.And then after picking a winner, you offer everyone else a big prize at a discount. Um, giveaways also go by names \\[...0.5s\\] sweepstakes. He had scholarship, like, all these are different terms.They all meet enter for a chance to win. Alright, and so giveaway offers, um, to run them, \\[...0.5s\\] 1, you should have to pick a grand prize and a promotional offer, right, so think your main thing and then \\[...0.4s\\] your, your participation trophy, whatever \\[...0.7s\\] ask for contact information.Now the promotional offer doesn't actually have to be different than the grand prize. It can usually be a discount on the main prize to be clear, \\[...0.4s\\] um, or just a truncated version or decreased time.It can be whatever spin you want, but typically it's gonna be some reason for it to be a little bit less than the grand prize and then a reason for them to buy now, right?Uh, we ask for information in eligible criteria, like you don't want veterinarians opting in for a, \\[...0.3s\\] you know um, \\[...0.9s\\] a retailers, uh, conference in Nebraska. If you've got people who are, uh, whatever veterinarians in Georgia, like it doesn't make sense, right?So you wanna make sure that they're eligible for your core services, otherwise why would you wanna give something away somebody who could never buy your thing?Anyways, right, so you can still create eligible criteria in order to get the giveaway, including questions or actions or anything you want them to add somebody to a group or post something. Like you can put as many criteria as you want or actions for them to take in order for them to be qualified.So then you put the giveaway on a deadline. This is super important because if you have a deadline, then, like, well, I mean, all marketing, right? You wanna have some sort of urgency that drives people to take action.And then also this is important when you have the giveaway and you, and you try to contact everyone else for the participation prizes.You want to make sure that those participation prizes and them claiming those prizes are also on deadlines, cause otherwise you'll just say like, hey, you won, and then no no no, no, do anything, right.And so you have to have urgency at each step \\[...0.7s\\] to drive action, which is just normal marketing step.But sometimes you forget, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, now beyond that, um, you wanna announce the grand prize winner, \\[...0.4s\\] obviously, and you also wanna give them the prize \\[...0.4s\\] obviously, duh, sometimes I have to say this, like, if you're going to advertise grand prize, you have to give the grand prize away, um, and then you contact everybody else and tell them about the promotional offer that they are eligible for, which is like, congratulations, we thought your \\[...0.6s\\] information was so compelling, we wanna offer you a partial scholarship.We thought your information so compelling, we thought we would offer this promotional offer. That's the grand prize thing that you said you wanted. It's like that but better, or like that but shorter, or like that but cheaper, whatever.Right, you just, you say you told us all this stuff, we think you're a good fit and as a result, we wanna give you this offer. Make your grand prize the thing you want everyone to buy.Alright, so make sure you assign a monetary value to your grand prize to serve as a price anchor for your promotional offer. So for instance, if you sell a 5, you know, 5,000 worth of value thing for two thousand dollars, then advertise the 5,000 dollar value.Let's say that's the giveaway. Next you pick your promotional offer. Alright, so this is a discount on the grand prize, a truncated version, some very small difference that allows you to charge even less \\[...0.4s\\] for your grand prize to people who kind of win the participation trophy.Alright, and the bigger the discount, the more compelling the offer, obviously, um, and so hint, the bigger the value you make this thing, um, the better, right?Remember, leads enter the giveaway because they found the grand price interesting. This is why this is such a key point is that, like, \\[...0.5s\\] everybody already says they want this thing, so you don't have to really, like, sell them on wanting. They already want it.We should make an offer good enough for them to say yes, \\[...0.5s\\] right. And so the promotional offer gets you customers because you offer what they already showed interested, \\[...0.7s\\] uh, at a discount.And the discount in the story I gave was the partial scholarship. Alright, and so you can call your promotional offer whatever you want, free business scholarship gift card voucher, dollars off \\[...0.4s\\] store credit \\[...0.4s\\] whatever, \\[...0.4s\\] right, the point is that you have a main thing and you got a, you got a gift card that somebody can win that can ply towards it.Bingo, bingo. So what else does someone need in order to qualify opt in? You obviously need the contact information, otherwise \\[...0.5s\\] you can't contact them. You want them to be eligible because if they're not eligible, they're not gonna be able to buy anyways, or they're not a good fit.And then I prefer to also, so this is kind of like, how do I talk to you, who are you? And then what actions have you taken that make you more likely to be either a great customer or \\[...0.5s\\] more likely to bring more other customers, which is gonna be a promotional activity.Alright, and so other stuff interests you to qualify. Um, I add these to promote my giveaway more, so I be like, you have to bring a friend \\[...0.4s\\] to my giveaway in order to qualify away.That could be a qualification. It could be you have to join my group, it could be you have to share this post, it could be, it could be you have to leave review. Like, there's 100 things you could have people, you could do them.All \\[...0.4s\\] right, now, the more friction you add, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, the, the fewer people are gonna want to enter the giveaway. So it's a little bit of a balance between these two things, but I'll say this in general for me.If you have a compelling enough grand prize, people will take a minute to follow some of the steps to become more qualified leads for you. So, yeah, other examples could be, you know, a taking a call or event, making a post, entering a group, right.And the key here is that we want them to either promote our stuff more or demonstrate hard quality of interest, which said differently is we want them to consume more of our information, so the more likely to make a purging decision when presented our promotional offer if they \\[...0.4s\\] don't win the main price.Once we have all this in place, we put the giveaway on a deadline to give away the free thing. So you pick a lot of razzle dazzle, hey, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 1, this, how many days left?It's me excited, everyone hop on, \\[...0.4s\\] right? We make it urgent by making only available for limited time, um, 3 to 7 days, I think works best.I think people's, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, attention spans are relatively limited, so I think, you know, weekish works. Well, \\[...0.4s\\] um, as soon as leads enter the giveaway, you wanna update them daily.So first, you let them know how long they have until, you know, it's the winner. Um, you can do this email, direct message, text, social media post, and so on.If you already have a community, you can do it there publicly, and then also, uh, one on one at scale, like, via broadcasts, um, and do as many as reasonable once today across all platforms tends to work pretty okay.Um, second, cause again you can do it, you can get away with once a day if it's a shorter thing, if you're gonna go longer, I probably wouldn't do every day for the 30 day giveaway, which you can do.There's, there's situations for that works \\[...0.5s\\] that, you know, if you're at 27 days out, you're like, I get it, you might opt out of the giveaway \\[...0.6s\\] by the end of it, so you might do, like, I would follow the Whisper t shout \\[...0.8s\\] framework that I have in the leads book.Um, in terms of, it's kind of, like a reverse launch, but you're, kind of launching a giveaway right \\[...0.4s\\] now.Second, uh, you provide value along with your countdown. So this is a point that I think a lot of people miss. Is you don't wanna just say the countdown, you also wanna be like, let me sell you on how this thing's amazing, how it's gonna change your life, which people are gonna be excited about.Like, let's see you give away vacation for whatever reason now we wouldn't give away vacation unless you're in the vacation business. I prefer you give away if you're gonna use this play the main thing you sell, but I'll just use vacation is simple, a simple example.If I give away vacation, cause I'm a travel agent right that vacation, \\[...0.5s\\] then what else am I gonna talk about? I wanna talk about the drinks they're gonna have. I wanna talk about the restaurants there. I wanna talk about the weather there. I wanna talk about the beach. I wanna talk about the views.I wanna talk about the hotel room. I wanna talk about all these things that I can use each day of my countdown, \\[...0.4s\\] provide value describing the grand prize, and so it doesn't seem like a take when I'm reminding them of this thing that they wanna win. And I'm talking about how great it is, \\[...0.4s\\] right.That's the key that I think people miss, rather than just like, it's coming, it's coming, like, that gets tiring, right, so just provide value along the way, \\[...0.5s\\] um, \\[...0.6s\\] beyond that, uh, show everyone the benefits, right.We just said that, um, and you wanna refer everyone to social proof, so this is both the benefits and proof that it's good.So if you do have, uh, that vacation, I'm saying if you've set other people on this grand prize vacation before, then it's like, hey, here's John and Sally who went on the thing to Egypt and they loved it.And then the next day, \\[...0.4s\\] here's the rooms, and then here's, you know, Kevin and Kelly who are saying how the, the rooms were spectacular, and how's the best hotel room they've ever seen in their whole life, and they wish they could live there.Right, each one of these, you wanna pair the benefit with proof around the benefit, ideally now a little pro tip, like I said, wish for TouTiao. You can use the exact same framework I have there for countdowns and urgency.Okay, so announcing the grand prize winner. Um, once you do that, you, then, so let's say you've got, you do you do a webinar, you do a big, a big raw raw, whether that's local on a stage, you invite everyone to a thing, you do a virtual call, whatever is fine.You do it in a group. I like to bring everyone together because it's gonna maximize my ability to sell and convert. All right. And so, um, \\[...0.8s\\] we announce it publicly, then we message everyone else privately.Alright, this is the key point. Many will enter, many will win. That's the key point of what makes this work, right? And so \\[...0.7s\\] now I'm not saying everybody wins the grand prize, but everyone gets a promotional offer to apply to the grand prize, which is awesome.That's the participation trophy because of \\[...0.4s\\] the work that they did, because they were such a great participant, because they commented the group, because they shared, because they told you a good story.You can use whatever because you want, but just give them a reason for why they're getting, uh, the voucher, the store credit, the gift card, the discount, whatever you want, let them know. Email, text, direct message on that, uh, big webinar presentation.You can also do the same structure which is people get on, and then afterwards you can say, hey, I saw you on there. And you can have your own team.Or if it's just you messaging them saying, hey, I think this should still be a good fit for you. I wanna do a partial scholarship, so I'm gonna be reaching out to some of you guys on this calling afterwards to get that set up.And then again, we have to restart our urgency because otherwise they're gonna be like, yeah, I'll do it someday. For the same reason, people don't buy and take action immediately, right?It's always easier just delay things, so we wanna drive the urgency, \\[...1.1s\\] so in that message, you ask them to schedule a call to redeem the prize, \\[...0.3s\\] and make sure they redeem the promotional offer again at another deadline.Okay, again three to 7 days tends to work well, and the second one works like the first, show the benefits, show more social proof, more valuable stuff about the offer.So I'm gonna give you a little bit of math on how to, like kind of, walk through this. So when you're explaining the promotional offer to winners, you wanna use, like kind of, cost of value using their discount, their store credit, the, the partial scholarship, um, that you're giving up, right.And so my rule of thumb is to make your promotional offer equal to 10 to 30% of your gross margins. Alright, and so for example, let's say we advertise a grand prize with a 5,000 dollar value, but a 2,000 dollar retail price tag.Alright, so the promotional offer winner gets, \\[...0.5s\\] gets it for 18 bucks, that's 10% off retail. Alright, but when we let them know they won the promotional offer, we explain that they get 5,000 dollars in value for an 18 dollar price tag, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, very exceptional.So if I'm that travel agent, for example, I might say, if you were to book this vacation not through me without all the discounts I can get, this will cost you$5,000 to do now.If somebody goes through my traditional services, I, I might say, okay, well, I can get this thing for$2,000. Um, and that's what I might be able to retail for, but my participation trophy winners will get 10, 20, 30% off.So that would be some there between \\[...0.4s\\] 200 and 600 dollars off my normal 2,000 dollar offer.But when I'm comparing it, I always have my baked in efficiencies of what they would have to do to get this on their own. If they were to just gonna get it true retail, not through my services as a travel agent.And so 5,000 dollars gets discounted, or they can see the discrepancy in value between 5,000 \\[...0.5s\\] and 18\\. So now it seems like a screaming hot deal which makes it more likely for them to take it right. And so you can just compare the difference of a 10% discount to a 64%. Very big difference since we wanna talk in those terms.All right, beyond that bottom line is that remember everyone entered the giveaway showed interest in your thing.If you remember, nothing else, this is the most important point. We want to sell the hell \\[...0.4s\\] out of our grand prize because we want people to be super interested and because there's a chance to win.So many more people want to dream about it. They want to imagine what life will be like. And so a lot of the persuasive techniques because there's a chance of winning it for free tend to be even more effective in this setting. Right? So I can't under I can like, I can't undersell this value to you.Like this is one of the things that makes it so powerful, also one of the reasons is regulated. Alright, and so if anybody shows interest in your thing, you should have it offer \\[...0.4s\\] to give to them. That's the point. Alright, and so that's how it works.I'll give you a couple examples real quick. So, um, if I were a dentist, \\[...0.8s\\] I might do a pre, uh, free Perfect Smile giveaway.So grand prize might be a free set of invisible braces, 6,000 dollar retail price. My promotional offer might be 2,000 dollar gift card for my braces, right, okay uh, if I have a physical products business, I might be doing a year of organic dog food subscription.Alright, so the grand prize \\[...0.5s\\] your, your food, a thousand dollar retail price, and the promotional offer might be a 300 dollar gift card for food only usable with a one year subscription, right, or only usable if you prepaid upfront. Like, you can put terms on these things.Um, the next is services offer, so let's say you have the free ultimate giveaway for whatever services you have.Alright, so, uh, free when your package 5,000 dollar retail price, your promotional offer is a 2,000 dollar voucher redeemable towards one year of service. Now if you have, you know, really crappy margins, then you're gonna cut this voucher doubt.That's okay. Um, \\[...0.4s\\] I prefer to tend, I prefer to sell higher, higher margin, uh, services, um, but these have things really drive behavior. Uh, if you had a consulting offer like a free 16 week turnaround, which could be \\[...0.6s\\] business, could be health, it could be relationship, it could be whatever.Right, so let's say that's a 12,000 retail price. It's my mega Cadillac super, super duper version. Um, my promotional offer might be a partial which might either be half the time or half the price or the same duration with one piece removed.No matter what, um, these things all combine together, um, and make a really compelling offer.There's some examples, a couple, couple little details for you. Um, talk to your law people about law things. Uh, make sure that they're legal in your area, the how you do it, eligibility criteria \\[...0.7s\\] get you more customers to buy the promotional offer.So I ask questions like to, you know, just to get ammo for a sales conversation. So why should we pick you? Why this program, why now, why does this matter to you? Why is this important? What are your goals?Right. These are all important questions you can ask in an application that then you can cipher, you know, go through them and say, oh, these are really good people. And you can also order the leads and score them missed on who you think is more likely to buy.You can also ask for income. You can ask for whatever you want, \\[...0.6s\\] um, if your giveaway doesn't work. So let me just troubleshoot this for you. It means your grand prize wasn't grand enough. So I had, um, had a portfolio company do a, do a giveaway \\[...0.8s\\] and it bombed. And I was like, \\[...0.7s\\] how did there are?They told me that it bonds, like the giveaways always work. Like how did this not work for you? And they told me the grand prize was free tickets to their event, which is like$300 for the tickets for the event.This is b to B business with a like 40,000 dollar thing. Um, well, like 15 to 40 somewhere in that range. Right? And so it's like, so why do we think that 300 dollars of value is in any way? Like if we're gonna sell 40,000 dollar stuff, we need at 40,000 giveaways at minimum.And so they reran the campaign with equipment for, uh, that business owner type that was$50,000 of equipment and then all of a sudden the giveaway worked. Right?And so like giveaways are only grand if you have grand prizes and they have to be super grand because people have to want them, \\[...0.5s\\] right? Um, here's a little pro tip for you. You can give away two prizes for twice the leads. I'll give you an example in the next slide. Uh, so this is from school, \\[...0.5s\\] so refer winner and you win too. So this is really I think this is sexy as hell.Alright, so I'll just read this to you, but many of many of you are inviting friends to play the games with you. And that's the point to make this is fun to encourage us even more. We're adding a new incentive, \\[...0.4s\\] right? If a person you refer gets in the top 10, \\[...0.4s\\] you get to come too. So they won prizes.And so the whole point is if you double your grand prizes, then what you can do is, hey, I'm gonna do this grand prize winner, but if you're the person you refer the grand prize winner, then you win a grand prize too.So let's say in that in that example with the equipment, I would say, okay, instead of$50,000 equipment, I'm gonna give two 50,000 packages.We can give two 25,000 packages, whatever, \\[...0.4s\\] two big packages, and so that then gets every single \\[...0.4s\\] person who's coming into the contest to say, wait, I can get way more chances to win. Like every person I refer gives me another shot to win.So there's a huge incentive now to refer tons of people, and this can double, triple quadruple the amount of leads you get in a giveaway if the giveaway is good enough.So again, \\[...0.5s\\] these are regulated for a reason, \\[...0.4s\\] all right, um, but this, this crushes, so highly recommend doing that. If you if you have the cash of the capital double the ATSETF, I would do it.All marketing rules apply, so scare C scare C seriously, limit your giveaway by time, number of entries or both. You can run the giveaways for specific amount of time, like 7 days, specific number of entry, like 5,000 entries or \\[...0.5s\\] both. I like both.Now I wanna be clear how would you use the scarcity part. Well, I tend to limit scarcity based on how many people, um, I have the time and resources to connect with. So if I don't have the team to be able to actually reach out to more than 200 leads, then I wanna I wanna put my, my \\[...0.8s\\] qualifications as high as possible. And I want to limit \\[...0.8s\\] the amount of entries to 200.That also increases the chances of winning, which makes it even more attractive for people to enter.All right, and so if you if you don't even have the band with the do more than 200 contacts, then cap it, \\[...0.4s\\] right. And if you can't do it, you can't reach out to those to 200 leads in, in any more than seven days.Then it's like, cap it at 7, 207 done, \\[...1.9s\\] which leads the next one urgency, urgency urgency, right. So I add urgency in three places for giveaways.Number one is to enter, No. 2 is to claim, No. 2, three is to use or to, um, to use the thing. Cause even once you have, let's say a scholarship that you give away, or once you give someone a \\[...0.4s\\] vacation, give them a time period to use it in, right, cause you want them to actually consume it.Cause \\[...0.4s\\] big picture even for all, and most importantly for all the partial scholarship winners, uh, this is important because you want them to start, you want them to become customers, you want them to buy, \\[...0.5s\\] right. And so this basically aligns with the three actions we need them to take.And so we put urgency around each, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, and make it clear in the advertisements how that works. So once you ask winners, let them know how long they have to claim, and when they do schedule their calls, some to the next week if you can.And then once you let them know what they want, tell them how long they have to use it. I like hours personally, but I've gone up to 5 days in short, just always have deadlines.So this is another, another little interesting tidbit, um, \\[...0.4s\\] on a little more advanced thing that I've Learned over the years, which is \\[...0.6s\\] when you have the participation trophy winner calls, when you have the promotional off basically calls for everybody who didn't win, but you still wanna get to buy something.Right \\[...0.4s\\] at the start of the call, let them know that they have two ways \\[...0.7s\\] to use their partial scholarship, their voucher, their gift card, their credit, whatever, all right, and that you'll help them find which way makes the most sense for them.And then offer the discount on the grand prize \\[...0.4s\\] thing first, if they take that awesome, if not, then offer the same discount by percentage on any other product that you have to make sense.So using the dentist example earlier, I might say, \\[...0.4s\\] hey, the grand prize is the full teeth and you're gonna get$2,000 off that. Now they might be like, I can't afford that.We might say, well, you know what? 80% your pictures are gonna be your top teeth, not your bottom teeth. So why don't we just do braces on your top teeth for$3,000, I'll give you a thousand bucks off that.Right, and so that way you can have a back pocket offer for people who still obviously wanna improve their smile. They still want the main thing, but they might not be able to afford it right now, or might not be right for the business right now.And the key is to just discount by the same percentage that way they don't feel like they're, they're losing out on their partial scholarship.Okay, \\[...0.4s\\] so if, uh, if you have a lot of no shows for in person appointments and that becomes an issue. Um, instead of doing mass notifications for people who qualified, I just reach out to them individually.Sometimes that happens, so just it basically just need to do more personalization when you get a hold of them, just let them know they have to claim the prize.So if you have recurring of any business, what you wanna do is apply the promotional discount over the longest period of time that they'll agree to, and then set up monthly subscription to Bill automatically at normal rates \\[...0.4s\\] after the discount of period ends.Okay, so let's say that someone wins, you know um a partial discount for whatever$2,000, \\[...0.4s\\] and you normally charge, \\[...0.6s\\] uh$6,000 are less for simple math, let's see, normally charge$8,000, you give them$2,000 off, that's$6,000 for the year.So then I would just reverse that into$500 a month, which then at the end of the year would bump up to whatever$8,000 divided by 12 is \\[...0.4s\\] right. Um, and that way you get the recurring revenue \\[...0.7s\\] on a on a regular basis.And again, that's you wanna spread it over as long as possible, but you wanna collect as much cash as possible front up front. So if someone will pay six up front, \\[...1.0s\\] do that obviously, uh, but if you can't do that, then extend it over as long period time.This is what I'm trying to help you avoid. You don't wanna say, okay, I'm gonna give you$2,000 for the first four months, and then you'll start getting billed on month five.Do not do that, it doesn't work, it sucks. I've already I've already got the scar tissue to show it. Don't do it, just try and spread it over longer periods of time.Alright, so there's the important points, so this is a quick, quick recap, so at the core free giveaways ask an audience to apply to get a high value thing of yours for free. Many will enter, many will win, \\[...0.8s\\] or one wins, and then \\[...0.4s\\] the rest win, win discounts.You wanna pick a grand prize that people want, it has to be sexy, you do a bad grand prize, like, do not be cheap on a grand prize. 2, give 2 prizes away if you want more people to refer. I think a grand prize should be about the value of your high cost thing \\[...0.5s\\] right now to be clear here.The reason this is also valuable is that if you give away something that you that retails that you actually sell for, let's say$10,000, \\[...0.4s\\] then it's really is only gonna cost you maybe two, 3 thousand dollars in terms of hard costs or services to deliver that thing.And so, like, that's a smoking hot, \\[...0.6s\\] like, it's not that much money compared how much you have to spend in marketing, right?Which is why cash giveaways are like my least favorite type of thing. Because, I mean I have done them, but they, they tend to be my least favorite because they are the least original. Now the plus side of cash giveaways is that they are valuable to everyone, right?And so if you are in a niche, which I hope you are, cause you know who your Avatar is, being more specific and making the grand prize around your service allows you to bake in the difference between what it costs you versus what the value of it is at a retail price. And I think that's a huge arbitrage opportunity. It also makes doubling the prizes when you give two away \\[...0.5s\\] easier.Cause if you give two 10,000 hour prizes away, that really only cost you two or three at hard costs, still works great. Okay, so, uh, then you wanna offer a chance to win the grand prize to anyone who enters and qualifies key point \\[...0.4s\\] and qualifies. No, just give it to any, like, they have to qualify in order to win.Uh, and you get great information from every lead because you make it part of the entry process.And this is why I think this is so magical. People are just willing to enter pages and paragraphs of themselves, whereas if you just did a normal Legion campaign, it's hard to get two or three fields, right, let alone here.You can get massive applications with whole life stories, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, built into them, because people wanna win something, \\[...0.9s\\] so get that information, um, and then it'll indicate how your offer provide more value to them.And this becomes it very important for when you offer your discounted or your promotional or participation trophy offers later \\[...1.5s\\] advertise your 7 \\[...0.4s\\] giveaway for, you know 3, 7 days \\[...0.6s\\] or hit the number of people that you can manage to call \\[...0.3s\\] in that time period, whichever comes first.Everyone who doesn't win the grand prize and qualifies gets offered the promotional offer, \\[...0.6s\\] book employment to the promotional offer winners to credit their win towards the grand prize, give them limited time to claim their prize, then put an expiration date on people claiming their prizes, making them more likely to claim it.And if somebody says no to your main participation trophy offer, have another product. Uh, that's probably like half the price to 1/3 of the price that you have in your back pocket to make available to them.Right, um, and it, cause it may suit them better. I would just keep the percentage discount the same, that way they still feel like they want something \\[...0.6s\\] beyond that.That is 80 free giveaways, those destroy, \\[...0.6s\\] like, murder across markets, physical products, brick and mortar online, \\[...0.4s\\] like these work, \\[...0.4s\\] so use them at your own \\[...0.8s\\] peril. \\[...1.6s\\]So we just covered win your money back and free giveaways is to my favorite attraction offers. Now we get into what I believe is the most flexible attraction offer that works for just about any business, which is the decoy offer.So \\[...0.7s\\] same 5 howler in the description examples important points in summary. Let's rock and roll, so how Learned it?So \\[...1.0s\\] John was a mentor of mine \\[...0.5s\\] at the very beginning of my career. He had 22 tanning salons, \\[...0.5s\\] and he \\[...0.4s\\] would drive me to his lake house, \\[...0.5s\\] you know a couple times during the summer, and we'd have these three or four hour long drives, and he would just, like, impart life wisdom on me.And John had lived, like, an amazing life, he took basically 20 years off \\[...0.5s\\] and just raised his daughters, and just went to the lake and, and and shot 16 ols ago, 5 days a week, and just like lived life. Um, and he had started from nothing, like really, really cool guy.And so anyways, he was telling me how his 5 day VIP \\[...0.4s\\] offer worked at his tanning salons.He's like, so it works like this. We offer 5 dollar VIP gift cards, we put them on people's windshield, that's how they used to advertise back in the day, and so he would come in with these gift cards for five bucks for a 5 day VIP pass to get tanned.Is it? The thing is, and this is the key part is that \\[...0.5s\\] people don't know how long it takes to get tan, and so \\[...0.4s\\] they come in for with the five dollar gift card, uh, for the VIP pass. And we give them the Turkey talk, which is basically \\[...0.5s\\] if you put a Turkey in, you can't cook it in 1/3 of the time.By, by ramping up the, \\[...0.4s\\] the temperature, you just burn the shit out of it, and the insides undercooked.And so taning, kind of, works the same way is that you need to have multiple sessions to get the right type tint, otherwise you burn. Right, we're like, oh, got it, and so, so you wanna get what shade of tan, so they would ask that when the person comes in.And then once they knew what shade of tan they wanted, cause it'd be easy to show them and say great, well, Turkey talk, got it.You're gonna need this amount of time, this many sessions, and so either you can pay 25 bucks per session, or why don't we just take that five dollar VIP and you can pay 1999 a month? We'll take it off the 1999, and you get unlimited as you want.Everybody saw the value, and they'd convert right into \\[...0.7s\\] EFTS, which is electronic fund transfers, which is just industry term for recurring membership.Alright, \\[...0.5s\\] so that's the VIP 5 day five dollar VIP story. Now fast forward a few years, so I'm now in gym launch where four, you know three, four years in, \\[...0.4s\\] and all of a sudden, like, our ads are not performing for the gyms. And I was like, okay, we gotta come up with some sort of new offer.So I have my team just try a bunch of different things. And I remember this 5 day VIP story and so we're like, hey, why don't we try this one out too?And so they tried this out in five different mini beta groups, and the winner was this free 21 day transformation. But here's how it worked. And so \\[...0.7s\\] when someone come in \\[...0.4s\\] the decoy offer, this is the five dollar VIP.This is that they think they can get tan in one session, but they can't really. Is we say cool. So we just said free 21 day transformation \\[...0.5s\\] when they come in, we'd say cool. The free version of this is you get one workout per week and you get at home nutrition course will give you this course, you can take it home and you work out once a week for the next 20 days, which three workouts, \\[...0.4s\\] okay, \\[...0.6s\\] or \\[...1.2s\\] will give you the unlimited version, so you work out as many times as you want over the next 21 days, will personalize your nutrition, will give you, uh, you know grocery store instructions, exactly what you need to buy will guarantee that you'll lose at least 10 pounds or 15 pounds in the next 21 days, or will give you another 21 days free on the back.And when presented those two offerers, they came in for the free 21 day transformation, but when they were presented the premium version, they said, you know what? I'd rather do that \\[...0.6s\\] up selling is as American as apple pie.There is nothing wrong with having an up sell as long as you still offer something that is free, that complies with what your original promise was in the advertiser.So if someone comes in, the key point of making this work is that you can advertise the \\[...0.4s\\] free 21 day transformation, not also you get all this stuff.If you say you get this other stuff too, then you have to deliver on it. And so the key is, this is one of the benefits of advertising results rather than the, the vehicle, because then you can choose the vehicle and associate price however you want in the sales presentation. Alright, and so this offer structure, \\[...0.4s\\] right, this money model is 100% based on the up cell.This is how all the money of this works. And the key, if you have the structure properly is 70, 80% of people should take the premium version. So \\[...0.8s\\] description, \\[...0.4s\\] so decoy offers advertise something free or discounted.So I could just as easily say 19 dollar or 21 dollar 21 day transformation. They come in and they say, cool, you can do the 21 dollar one year to pay for it, or I'll credit your 21 dollars towards a 421 dollar thing which will roll it towards, and now you can ban extra 400 bucks today and you're in, right.So then when Leeds asked you learn more, you also present the more valuable premium offer. And the premium offer provides more features, benefits, a bonus \\[...0.4s\\] guarantees \\[...0.6s\\] and so on.So by putting your decoy offer and premium offers next to each other, they can see how much more valuable your premium offer is.And so I like decoy offers so much because they get more customers overall, and so they either take the decoy version \\[...0.5s\\] or they get the premium version. This is an assumed close that means everybody buys.I like that. Now if they take the premium version, great. If they take the decoy offer \\[...0.4s\\] also great, and guess what?You can also grab a couple of the bonuses from the premium and toss them in, because you're like, hey, I know you're only taking the one workout a week thing, but let me do some personal nutrition for you.Come back in a week, I'll come back in two days, and guess what we do at the first Nutrition Council did sell$300 is all of us, haha, and so \\[...0.5s\\] it's, it's all good, alright, but either way, here's the thing is you close everyone, and this makes it cheap and profitable get new customers, \\[...0.6s\\] and \\[...0.5s\\] any business can do this. You literally just take what you have, \\[...0.5s\\] well, I'll get into what it is.Okay, so here are the steps to make a decoy offer: 1\\. Advertise a lesser, smaller or simpler version of your premium offer as the decoy offer.Then when leasing gauge offer both options, but emphasize the premium amount, and use the bonuses, the premium value in the guarantees to close the additional people.All right, \\[...0.8s\\] now let's do some examples. So let's say I have a lemonade stand, this is to prove the point that works with literally any business. All right, so you, the attraction offer is, this is like, what the headline of the ad might be.So you say, hey, free week of lemonade for all first time customers. Okay, now I'm not giving any features, I just said free week of lemonade. Now option A, this is the free week, is that you can have this free plus water and powder. Uh, this warm water, right and artificially sweetened, and it may give you digestive issues.Uh, but you can absolutely have this free lemonade, or \\[...0.4s\\] you can have the organic, all natural vegan, gluten free imported Italian lemons, which are cold distilled and shipped straight to your door so you never waste time coming into the store. And so, it's like, which one do you want? Right?Of course you want this one, you want the premium one, and so that's what people take.So let's say you've got, um, this is actually a Floatex center. I had an agency that did float tank stuff for a minute, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, in Allen. So they used a free six week stress release challenge. Okay, so the attraction offer was a free six week stress release, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, or, um, as you can say a six dollar six week stress release.Either way that for your discount \\[...0.9s\\] decoy option, you get one float \\[...0.4s\\] per month with at home do it yourself stress relief exercises, or premium option is 2 a week \\[...0.5s\\] floats for 6 weeks, 1, 0, 1 consulting journal sleep routine and a satisfaction guarantee. Guess what? Everyone took \\[...1.0s\\] this one.All right, \\[...0.5s\\] now the gym offer, this is the local one, so this is basically the breakdown of what we did. So free 21 day transmission or 21 dollar transformation workouts done in a school com group \\[...0.4s\\] once a day and a general transplant. So, it's like, we're local business.You can get one workout here, the rest of the workouts you can just do online, right, you can watch the recordings, you get no support, you get no guarantee, \\[...0.5s\\] or you get unlimited workouts, a personalized research plan accountability results guarantee, or, you know, this one, it is free.So now important points, \\[...0.6s\\] all right, so how to make your decoy offer, \\[...0.7s\\] offer fewer components, \\[...0.3s\\] older models or less personalized versions of your premium offer?Some of you guys are like, I don't know, I can think, make my, my Digway offer, \\[...0.3s\\] think about what you have, make it less personal, make \\[...0.4s\\] even older version of what you did, give them that, like, these are, you just peel off features that cost you the most money.All right, and then the thing is, is your attraction offer only has to get people to engage, nothing more. You just need people to get optins for it, which is why you want to talk more about the outcome and less about the vehicle.Now, yeah, advertise benefits, not the features recover though. Alright, so now you can advertise discounts in four ways. We recover that one earlier, but as a reminder, \\[...0.5s\\] uh, if you have your loan thing and you give and it's 100 bucks a month, and you wanted them to pay$900 for the year, you could say 25% off, you could say$300 off, you could say three months free, or you could say one year for$900, 12 bucks, \\[...1.0s\\] all different ways of saying the same thing.So these are all useful, especially with decoy offers, cause often times they are discounts.Alright, so \\[...0.6s\\] the key to making this work is that the contrast has to be huge. Alright, the bigger the contrast, the better the deal, the more customers will take it. If people keep taking your free offer your free offer is too good, \\[...0.5s\\] and your paid offer is not good enough. So you wanna keep doing this until the obvious offer is to take the premium offer.Alright, discount offers have high up sharp rates, then free offers just as a pro tip, if you do have these issues, you can do the 21 dollar thing. If you have sharp rate issues in your market, if possible, present the premium offer first.Now if they ask for the decoy offer, \\[...0.5s\\] most people don't, you then present it, but I'll show you how to do this. Okay, so what you wanna do is get them to give you permission to sell them. So if they ask to hear about the decoy, then you're legally obligated to present it.On the other hand, some of you guys might be a little bit weak in the stomach about just offering something straight for the, \\[...0.4s\\] the high, high value thing.But here's, let me just share a little bit of, like, advertising scars. And, like, years of doing this, \\[...0.5s\\] almost no one remembers what they opted in for. They barely remember the ad, \\[...0.4s\\] and so they just, they will remember that this thing solve the problem that they have. And then when you, they come in, you can just make the offer that you wanna make them.Now if they do remember that thing, then by all means tell them about it. But if you are somebody's, like, I want to always offer the really cheap thing first, fine, this works in the opposite way of price anchoring, but fine, \\[...0.6s\\] have it your way.So if you're gonna do it that way, here's how you do it. So you ask them a sorting question first, you say, are you here for free stuff or lasting results? \\[...1.6s\\]Everybody's gonna say lasting results, some people will say free stuff, and those people suck, and you can just kick them out basically. Um, but as soon as they say results, which most people do, you skip straight to premium. So this way you've gotten permission to then sell them the premium offer \\[...0.4s\\] now.If they say free, then you say the free thing, and then you present the premium, so this way you can still have them \\[...0.4s\\] ethically select to get the premium offer first by asking the question because you asked them before you made the offer.Now if they then at the end of the premium offer say, yes, I wanna buy it, \\[...0.4s\\] shut up and close the sale, that's it, you don't offer anything else.If they say free stuff, you present the decoy offer and then immediately contrast, like, you don't even give them the opportunity to say yes to it, you say, and, and then you go right into the next thing.All right, and so then only after presenting both offers, \\[...0.7s\\] you then say, \\[...0.6s\\] this is key, \\[...0.4s\\] which do you think will get you to your goal faster? \\[...1.1s\\] Or \\[...0.5s\\] which one would you prefer to have? \\[...1.5s\\]And the thing is that everyone will prefer the better one, and everyone will think the other one will get them to the goal faster, or you can also ask which one you think is more likely to help your goal.All three of those questions are fine. They \\[...0.4s\\] obviously force \\[...0.4s\\] the selection of this one, and they say great, and then you close the sale.Alright, \\[...0.5s\\] and so you say, \\[...0.5s\\] so which one do you prefer? And then they say great, they have the premium offer, and then you can move forward in the sale, mutually agreeing that is the best thing for them.So \\[...0.4s\\] when making your premium offer, get excited about so presented as a superior \\[...0.6s\\] offer to the decoy offer. Because it is, and assuming that it is how it is in the customer's best interest. So your excitement about this thing will move it other people to take action \\[...0.6s\\] according to your preferences.So from a selling perspective, you wanna talk to the lead as though you already know they're gonna make this offer, like, they are gonna take the premium offer, be like, it's almost in a, like, this is such a no brainer.Anybody who doesn't take this offer is like, I don't even understand the people, like, \\[...0.7s\\] almost this is where, like, if you're a salesman, especially if you work for a business, you're gonna be like, I don't even know why we offer this other thing.Like, you can do it if you want, but, like, this is where everyone gets all the great results.And even how I'm saying this is very matter of fact, very, like, \\[...0.6s\\] like, \\[...1.4s\\] it makes no sense to me why someone would select that. And people will take all the subconscious using your body language in your tone of which thing they should pick.So for example, I said you want this, do you? \\[...1.2s\\] There, that's a guaranteed, no, I'm, I'm asking them to say no to something. That's what I'm saying, \\[...0.4s\\] and so how you present the offerers is obviously based on your ability to sell. But I'm trying to give you stack the deck in your favor to make this easy for you.So you will operate from the position of this is what everyone does. This is just a formality. Let me get your ID and credit card, so you can get your value.No hype, just friendly disposition almost \\[...0.4s\\] board \\[...0.5s\\] about how regularly you have to do this. It's like, yep so we've got this thing, not really sure why people do that, but this is the main thing. Great, give your card on you, give your ID on you, and then you just move right to it.Surprise benefit. That's optional to take this a step further. If someone takes the decoy option, you can choose to surprise them with a few zero or low cost features from their premium offer.Just say, hey, I'm gonna throw this in even though it's part of our premium offer, just because I want you to get great results. This also builds goodwill.It also reinforces that you were being truthful about saying I really do think this other thing is better for you, and that you do wanna actually help them.So it's aligned with the scripting in the sale, \\[...0.4s\\] right, so this builds goodwill, it over delivers, and it increases the chance that they take your upsell offer later. Remember, they're still elite, and if they bought the decoy, if it's a free thing they haven't bought yet. If it's not a free thing they paid, they're still a customer.And \\[...0.8s\\] if you followed any of my stuff, you absolutely should still upsell them halfway through, whatever this thing is. And if you give them some stuff now, that's good, they will probably increase, likely that they will take more of your stuff that's good later.So \\[...0.4s\\] in summary, decoy offers \\[...0.5s\\] advertise something for your discounted, then when the leads ask to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium offer. Make the premium offer far more valuable than the decoy option by adding more features, benefits, benefits and guarantees.Strip down your decoy, your main offer to your decoy offer as much as is reasonable. When leads ask out the decoy offer, present your premium offer right next to it. All right, ask if they're here for free stuff or loching results to get permission to put the premium offer first.If you still don't want that, then you put the decoy offer and then kind of like like I mean you can do that, but this is what people get the best results on, and you can still make money from the leads who pick the decoy option.You'll just learn the best way to deliver your decoy product and maximize up sales from it. Expect to make money fast. If you're not, then make the contrast between the offers bigger. \\[...1.7s\\]By the way, \\[...0.4s\\] if you're a company doing over$1 million or more in profit and want \\[...0.4s\\] us to invest as partner to help you scale, you can go to acquisition. Com and hit the sell button. If you just want help scaling, you can hit the scale button.If you don't have a business, hit the \\[...0.5s\\] start a business one, which I'll just tell you will route you to school.com. So that concludes the decoy offers. Let's get to by X, get y free. \\[...0.1s\\]"

They just keep getting better, um, and right now your, your mind is probably moving like, shoot, I could use all these.Yes, yes, you could. That's the point, that's why these things are survival, so now we move on to pay less now or pay more later, \\[...0.4s\\] also super sexy, so let's save it same big 5, how I Learned description examples important points. This is my big fancy \\[...0.4s\\] drawing \\[...0.5s\\] big and fancy enjoy.All right, so how I Learned it, so I went, I got this email for double your reading speed in three hours, or it's free by the world's fastest reader.And so I was like, sure, okay, so I clicked to register, and so they said, uh, put your credit card down for zero dollars and get build 300 bucks \\[...0.5s\\] after the training EDS, and if your reading speed doesn't double email us, and we won't Bill you, you have to attend to be eligible. I was like, that's pretty fair.Like I mean, if I could double my reading, I would pay$300 for that. And I get to decide if I double my reading \\[...0.8s\\] after I decide to pay, after I've doubled it already. Is like, that's kind of cool. So I said, I clicked, okay.And then the next page said, or \\[...0.6s\\] pay$97 right now and get the recordings from it for free. And I was like, oh, \\[...0.8s\\] I kinda want the recordings. But I will say I was younger and I was broker and I was like, I wanna make sure it works. And so I decided to not take this offer now.On the 3 hour training, whatever, the first hour and a half or two hours, \\[...0.5s\\] he had an objective point in the middle where he was like, okay, now I want.He tested us in the very beginning and then at the halfway point he tested us again. You know, everybody who raised their hand said, yep, my, you know, reading seat bubbles were like, oh, I tripled it, whatever it was, \\[...0.4s\\] um, some people didn't.And then he like called this people out, try to help them like live, whatever. And then after that, just at the very end, he was like, by the way, if you thought this was good, this is what the progress we made in, you know, two hours.If you want, I have an eight week contents on the back end that will even further increase your reading speed and your comprehension. And so you can read at a fast rate and contain more.And ultimately, like, learning is the meta skill of everything. Like if you learn this one skill, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? And so I ended up not doing that, but I was like, wow, this is really interesting.He gets all these people on. He makes money from the 90 sevens. He makes money from the three 90 sevens, and he then pitches people another thing. I was like, this is pretty cool. So that's how I Learned it. And I was like, I wonder if I could do something like this for my business and you can too.So let's dive in. So in pay less now, pay more later, you give people choice to pay full price later with an implied guarantee of satisfaction or pay discounted price now. This plague removes all risk from the customer, which is why it's so compelling.The other amazing thing is that you can advertise it. It's free because they put$0 down, and they only pay after they get it if they want. So they pay later and only if they like it. And it combines the benefits of a delayed payment and a satisfaction guarantee. So it gives us both. It's like, it's a delay and satisfaction. That's why it makes it so compelling for people, and anyone can sell this.Almost anyone agree to pay later if they're satisfied. So from a salesmanship perspective for your business, if you're, like, not that good at sales, this offer \\[...0.8s\\] primo, but once they agree to pay later, you can then get them to pay now with hefty discounts and valuable bonuses, like in this example, the recordings was a very valuable bonus.You can also stack other bonuses as well as discounts. So it's like, oh my god, which also by the way, shows you the value of delayed payment and guarantees how much you have to discount and how many bonuses you have to stack.Shows you the relative value of a guarantee and a delayed payment. So the pay later option allows you to advertise free since you can choose to pair not. And this gets lots of leads to engage, but this free offer has an added benefit which is we get their card on file. So this works just as much online as it does in person.So whether you have either type of business, it works the same way because if they choose this option and they hate the product, then they can cancel it anytime before the charge goes through.But if they accept the pay later option, then we can make follow up offer to pay now and the option could ride the whatever 20, 50% discount, sometimes 2/3 discount like the 97 example I gave and greater bonuses.And since we already have the card and file, we make it easy for them to pay because now we already have it, \\[...0.4s\\] right?And so whether they choose to pay now or pay later, you've got customers unlikely some profit, but to take full advantage of this offer, you want something else to sell, so have something more better or newer to offer them when the time is right.All right, \\[...0.4s\\] you wanna market the core value as free w reading speed, \\[...0.4s\\] the prospect puts the card down for the to consume the service of value at the end.They're built for the service at full price now again, if you offset your \\[...0.6s\\] cost, you car the customers with the$97, whatever the immediate thing is, then you want as many people to pay the three times as expensive thing, so it's not that you wanna force everyone to do that.And I'll talk about the balance between the price points later, but \\[...0.6s\\] the objective is not to get everyone to pay now or even to pay later.It's to balance it just enough to offset your cost to car customers, and then get as many people to then, uh, basically delay payments, you can make three times the amount.Alright, and so you can charge more for the thing since it's a late purchase to the same degree, people will agree to pay more later than they will now. And so you can also boost the price, because also, if, so you, if someone, \\[...0.7s\\] it basically means what's the price of the guaranteed delivery.So when you \\[...0.4s\\] have someone pay today, there's a, \\[...0.7s\\] a risk \\[...0.8s\\] metric that they apply to the purchase on the risk that they don't get what they think they're going to get.If I said, hey, you only pay me after you get a six pack, then people were like, oh, then the value of a six pack is directly related to the price that they pay, which means I could charge way more for that thing because it's at a delay, \\[...0.6s\\] and so we wanna give the one time offer, uh, of the same thing for 1/3 to 1/2 the price plus bonuses and guarantee to get more people to buy now.Great, \\[...0.5s\\] alright, so let's do some examples, cause some people were like, okay, I get how I work for the reading story, but how's it work for other businesses? So pay later 0+ 2\\. 99, after 3 hour training, pay now 1\\. 49\\. 97, doesn't matter, recording plus notes.Okay, now, so you're like, wait, if this is 20 to 50, I thought you said 67, doesn't really matter, you just pick the discount amount that \\[...0.6s\\] the college is your objective for offsetting as much cash as you need to break even on the acquisition now up, so \\[...0.8s\\] and also to be clear if you are doing this, this thing is happening all within 30 days.I also include the cash I get from the pay later option, because they're still paying it at 30 day window. So if I get some today, and then some in two weeks, or some in three weeks, or some in four weeks, I still get it before I pay my card back, whatever doesn't matter to me.Now up sale, the up sale, here is the a week w reading speed thing, cool, so we have 3 offers, pay later, pay now, up sale, that's how this works. Now let's say I'm in the, you know, find your first real estate deal.Okay, fine. I do a 3 day workshop, pay later for$0 for 3 day workshop. They get both$500 the end unless they cancel. Pay now is 2\\. 99 \\[...0.5s\\] for the 3 day workshop plus the recordings, plus someone will call with the distress property expert, plus pretty materials that they can use at the workshop.Kind of compelling. Now the upsell is that when they go to the three day workshop, guess what you do? You sell$30,000 to take them through every other step of closing their first deal within six months, plus legal templates, uh, an advisorative at the investment inspection checklist, whatever.I don't think I mentioned this yet. But one of the really sexy parts about this is that because every single person registers puts car down the show rates are astonishing.They're very, very good \\[...0.6s\\] cause every single, like, you think, like, oh, this, how do I make sure people come to the workshops? Like, dude, everybody put a car down physical products do this right, 14 day clothing trial, so they have a pay later option,$0 now get it, then get build one 49 to 14\\. 8.Amazon started doing this, it's try before you buy, \\[...0.4s\\] like this, like this works in any business.Alright, so the pay now option is you pay$97 for the clothing plus you get an accessory to go with it, \\[...0.7s\\] but you can have this offer because then you could advertise that people would try for free, but you'd still wanna monetize it sooner.The off sale could be that the dress comes with an offer for monthly subscription to more dresses or more clothes, or clothes in this style. And the customers have to return the product in, like, new condition before billing to qualify for the guarantee. Now let's do a local business.I'm giving more examples because people tend to be less creative. Alright, so let's say you've got trim your hedges, alright, like \\[...0.4s\\] very normal, \\[...0.5s\\] you know, local business. So the pay later option would be$0 lawn cut plus hedges. And then after we do it and it's to your liking at 600 bucks \\[...0.6s\\] or \\[...0.4s\\] three 69 now lawn cut hedges and lawn treatment.And some people were like, why is it so expensive? I have big houses, whatever, fight me, I'm kidding. You can choose change the prices to whatever you want is really better, or you can make this$59 is 30 to 36 dollars. It's fine, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, relax, \\[...0.4s\\] relax, you're gonna be okay.All right, now up sale, so \\[...0.4s\\] the up sale from there is the one 99 a month \\[...0.4s\\] up for long care services. And so then the rep comes, the house, makes the estimate and then offers both options, then up sales once the work is done.And so when they go there to say, hey, we can trim the edges and you can pay me right now or you can pay me after the things done, you can pay more, \\[...1.3s\\] right?And then as soon as we get the card, then you give me the Upsoles boom important points. Okay, so \\[...0.8s\\] here's the key part, promise a clear yes, no result.So first you make a promise yes, no.Second, make sure you can deliver on it within your time frame. If you don't, \\[...0.7s\\] they will ask to not be built, and so you wanna make this as objective as possible for people, so they can say, yes, I found my first deal, yes, I got my first reply from an email.Yes, my reading speed doubled, cause I got to hear, like, and you wanna have some sort of measurement before and some sort of measurement during, so you can see the progress.So for example, if you promise to decrease in so much shoulder paint, have them rate their paint \\[...0.4s\\] before you do your magic trick, and then ask them to rate it after.If it went down, you succeeded, and you can sell them something else. Keep the promise simple, clear and measurable. This avoids unnecessary cancellations.Now make a conditional satisfaction guarantee, so people can only cancel the billing if they qualify. For example, they had to show up to the reading training to qualify. Alright, it's key point, and so if you don't show up to the workshop, then you can't ask for the refund.So think attendance showing up for an appointment, turning in data, make the criteria what people \\[...0.4s\\] do to get the value out of the product, all right, which should make you feel good too, cause then you could explain it.So I listen, I have this as the criteria because you said you wanted w reads me. You're not gonna w read me. If you, unless you show up, you're not gonna find your just, just pressed up \\[...0.4s\\] property, unless you come to the workshop. \\[...1.0s\\] Have bonuses for your, uh, pay now offers to get even more buyers.Alright, so if you want more people to take that pay now option, just stack the bonuses, decrease the price, \\[...0.5s\\] um, optimizing your pay now and pay later offers.If too many people take your pay later option, discount the pay now option more, add better bonuses or both. And if too many people take your pay now option, go the other direction.If more than 10% of pay later people cancel their payment, you promise too much, \\[...0.5s\\] the guarantee conditions are too low or the price is too high.And so the last ones, the one that can be kind of tricky is if you have \\[...0.4s\\] a massive discrepancy between pay now and pay later, then sometimes people will get the value and just be cheapskates. That's why having the objective measure of whether they got the thing is so important for this.Now again, I would explain that 10% is what you should target or what you should expect.So \\[...0.5s\\] 10% of people who have pay later \\[...0.4s\\] are going to just say, don't bail me. So just fact it in the cost of doing business. So if you have 100 people that do pay later, expect 10 to say that now. If like 20 say that more than then it's like okay, we need to change.One of these other things \\[...0.8s\\] I would say the four things that you're selling people who can't afford \\[...1.5s\\] note. No matter how well you deliver, some people will cancel the payment and that's okay. Just cost to do a business.Now \\[...0.5s\\] this works for current revenue businesses too, cause you're like, how does this work for those businesses?Let me explain. So you just give them the option to pay higher ongoing rate 30 days later, or they pay less today, and they keep the better rate for good, \\[...0.6s\\] right, really sexy. So plus, you can add in some bonuses, so I'll I'll, I'll just give you one line down.We'll talk more about it in the one time bonuses chapter, uh, with continuity, but it works like this.Someone does a free trial \\[...0.7s\\] of whatever your subscription is into$400 a month, and then on the thank you page, you say, or \\[...0.4s\\] you can pay$300 today, skip your trial, \\[...0.7s\\] and you get to lock in at$300 a month for life, pretty sexy.That's, but now in order to do that, you would add bonuses, and that also gives you a lifetime discount.There's two, there's two benefits from that, which is why it makes such a compelling offer, but you can advertise the thing as a free trial, but then you can liquidate the acquisition because you have the immediate thank you page offer. So \\[...0.7s\\] if you run events, workshops, presentations, hint at your next offer early.So if the reading guru had said everyone wants to know when my next reading intensive starts because they sell out so fast, I'll get to it at the end, but please pay attention, I wanna deliver on the promise I made to you guys to double your reading speed first by hinting about his new offer. He would have sold more of it and he didn't. But if he had, I might have had a higher likely to buy.And so I used to do a lot in nutrition consultations, and this is what I Learned myself doing.This is I would start my consultation by being like, listen, everybody wants to know what's up was to buy. We're gonna get to what's up was to buy, but right now we gotta get your way ins. We gotta get you to understand food, that's the most important part.Everything I just said was true, \\[...0.5s\\] but by saying everyone wants to buy, everyone wants to know what to buy. I I, I see \\[...0.5s\\] the idea that they're all going to buy something, but I see it in a way that's not, \\[...0.4s\\] it's me talking about everybody else, not the people in the room.And so I would say, hey, people are gonna interrupt me all, you know, to ask about supplements, and it annoyed me, and I did it one time by accident, and then of course, it worked really well. And then I started doing it every other time on purpose.Alright, and so \\[...0.6s\\] by accident I implied the people who, uh, that everybody bought supplements without actually offering them.And all the head, head nods actually showed that they actually did want more products. And so all these factors got more people to buy when I finally asked them to. So it was a happy mistake that I was sure to repeat.Now if you're selling over the phone, \\[...0.4s\\] get the card first, then ask, oh yeah, I forgot to ask you, do you wanna save 200 bucks on that price? So I'm giving you different selling environments.So if you're selling a person, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, I explained that the one key thing if you sell \\[...0.4s\\] digitally, the thank you page thing, if you're selling over the phone, you get the card first for the trial, you get the card first for the pay later option.Then you ask, like, the thank you pages once they've agreed to that purchase, then you say, by the way, I forgot to mention, do you wanna save a little bit of money or say whatever the price is and get these extra things. A lot of people say yes, \\[...0.5s\\] and then you should explain.Yep, so for people who decide to just sign up without waiting to experience it first, if you want to skip the trial, you get VIP seating and recordings from the event, and you get it for$200 less than if you wait, and you won't be able to get those two other bonuses at any time.You wanna go ahead and do that, and so the more compelling those bonuses are, the more people say yes. Great, \\[...0.4s\\] now let's summarize this, be \\[...0.7s\\] all right, so pay less now, pay more later offers people to a choice to pay \\[...0.7s\\] full price or pay discounter price with additional bonuses if they pay now.The pay later option has a delayed payment with a conditional guarantee, have a clear criteria to qualify for the guarantee and easy ways to measure it if you can align the criteria with what gets people the most value from the product.The pay now option \\[...0.6s\\] offers a 20 to 50%, sometimes to thirst discount and bonuses if they pay now, depends how desperate you are to get people to pay. Offer customers the pay now option after they already accept the pay later terms.Alright, so if they choose to pay now, then they get the discount and bonuses instead of the guarantee instead of in lieu of, alright, now you make your promise easy to track and difficult to refute.So not only is it easy track, but they can't say they didn't have it. The easier is attracting, the hardest to refute, the better it is for this type of offer.So you want it to be as clear as a yes, no. And if you have more than 10% cancelling the pay later option, you promise too much. The guarantee conditions are too low, or the price \\[...0.5s\\] is too high, and or the people you're selling to are not the right people.Alright. So also give extra attention to the customers who claim they haven't gotten value.If you remember during the thing, if people didn't say they raised their hand and they didn't double the reading speed, he attended to them so you could check off the kids, he basically \\[...0.6s\\] purposely brought down the cancellations that he was going to get later.And so there it's really easy to tip people over the edge. It probably takes especially an in person thing. You can just easily check those boxes off, and it'll save you a ton of money \\[...0.6s\\] in cancellations. And that is the pay list now or pay more later. \\[...2.0s\\]So we just covered win your money back, free giveaways and now decoy offers. And one thing that I will highlight before we get into buy XKI Free is that an ethical salesman makes recommendations that he believes will help the customer and help the business.An unethical salesman makes recommendations to customers that will not help the customer and only helps the business. And so you making more offers to customers in no way unethical. It is unethical \\[...0.5s\\] basically if you lie.And so you're either lying to them about them being qualified for something, or you're lying to them about the quality of the thing that it will get delivered to them.Either way, fundamentally bad salesmanship is rooted in deception. Good salesmanship is rooted in education. And if the education is true, which it should be, then the customer should just find out as much about what they need to do to make a decision as, you know.And so fundamentally, if you were a customer and you were selling your mother and she had as much information as you, then she should buy \\[...0.4s\\] the same things you would recommend to her.With that being said, \\[...0.4s\\] buy X, get y free. Let's rock and roll. So \\[...0.4s\\] buy X, get y free super, super common offer. There's a lot of different ways to do it and there's like very advanced tactics, which is why I love this offer so much.Like this thing, it's funny because I like the first three and I also love this offer too. Like it's a banger. So we'll cover the main five. Here's how I Learned it.So \\[...0.7s\\] I was in downtown Nashville. I went to school in Nashville called Vanderbilt. And I remember when I, when I got to Vanderbilt for the first time, um, I remember going downtown and there was this, uh, thing called Boot Factory.And Boot Factory had \\[...0.8s\\] this massive booth, is bigger than car, big flashing like almost like Vegas lights and \\[...0.6s\\] on all the windows it said, \\[...0.8s\\] buy \\[...0.7s\\] one pair, get to free. And I was like, this \\[...0.4s\\] business, these guys are idiots. Like they're just giving away their boots. And I being, you know like, of course, fresh to college out of high school, knowing literally nothing about anything, I assumed that I was more intelligent than the store owner who obviously was doing very well. And so, uh, I came back 10 years later \\[...0.6s\\] and they had expanded. And so I was like, huh, that's interesting.Now, 10 years later, I had a lot more business document. And so I went in \\[...0.5s\\] and I like looked around, poked around, \\[...0.4s\\] and I saw \\[...0.4s\\] that the pairs of boots had each of them had multiple markdowns on the price, down to$600 for one pair, at least the ones that I looked at.And so it was instead of saying \\[...0.6s\\] buy one fairly priced boots or buy 20% off, they had buy one, get two free. But if you bought three pairs of boots for$200 each, that's still like a pretty normal price for leather boots.And so the ones that I like, the ones I was looking at were not like stingray or, you know, hippopotamus or something like they were, they were normal leather. And so I realized that they had just fully baked the cost of three into one pair, and then said buy one, get two free.And the thing is, is that because of that, \\[...0.4s\\] all the bachelor parties would pile in because the bride would get one and then the other two friends would get them free, or one of the friends would buy a pair and give one to the bride and one to her maid of honor or whatever. And they just milked it.And so that is how I Learned \\[...0.5s\\] this more valuable way of doing buyance get wife free.So \\[...0.4s\\] let's get into it. So in buyance get wife free offers, customers buy something, they get other stuff free. Cool, makes sense. The more free stuff they get and the higher its value, the better it works. Buy one get two free works better than buy two get one free.Free offers get way more attention than discount offers, but if you only have one thing to sell and give it away, then obviously \\[...0.4s\\] you got hungry.If you just say like, buy here's free boots, that's not gonna work, right? So \\[...0.4s\\] in situations like this, they tend to lean on discounts. Alright, most businesses do so they run sales relying on holidays, seasonal changes or whatever, \\[...0.5s\\] as you know, reasons to temporarily lower the price for whatever the thing is to get more customers.But by selling more than one thing at once, you can turn discount offers into even stronger free offers. This is the magic of BIEX get y free. It will take a 33% discount and it can make it into buy two get one free, which is far more compelling.And rather than getting \\[...0.5s\\] two thirds of one ticket, you still get someone to buy two full priced items, but you still effectively gave them a one third discount which you would never advertise because why would you advertise that when you could buy two and get one free? It's more strong.Alright, so I'm gonna give you a lot of different ways to slices, cause this is what I wanna help you match this to your business. So when you have more than one item, you can make the discount value large enough that it covers the price of more stuff.For example, I could sell three t shirts \\[...0.6s\\] for$30 price of$10 each, \\[...0.9s\\] or \\[...0.4s\\] I could sell one T-shirt for 30 \\[...0.4s\\] and get two free. In both situations, I give away three shirts and get$30, but the perception, think about the difference here, if I said, hey, buy three shirts for$10 each, how compelling is that?Not that compelling. If I said buy one sure, get 2 free, I'm gonna for sure get way more attention, but the economics are the same \\[...1.1s\\] powerful. Now I'mma give you another example \\[...0.6s\\] now if I wanted to offer a discount rather than only reframe the price, so the example here, I just reframe the price.I'm still getting the same$10 for sure, \\[...0.4s\\] zero discount here. I just re \\[...0.6s\\] reframed how I'm, how I'm pricing my offer. \\[...1.2s\\] If I wanted to also use this plus a discount, I could sell three shirts \\[...0.7s\\] for six dollars and sixty seven cents. So it's like buy three shirts for$20, that would be the discount version. Or I could now say \\[...0.7s\\] buy one shirt for 20 and get two free.Same thing, it's still effectively a, \\[...0.4s\\] uh uh uh, a 1/3 discount, but it accomplishes the same objective. Okay, so there's two examples are, sorry, this, that's the description. Now I have more examples for you.Alright, so \\[...0.5s\\] buy one get two physical products offers. This is the Boot Factory offer, one pair is 200 dollars, buy xny free. Buy one pair for 600, get two pairs free. So the end result is to still buy 3 pairs of 200 dollar boots.Alright, now here's three versions of this that I wanna break down for you to show you the power of this. So if you said buy 12 months, get six months free for 818 hundred dollars. Okay, that's an offer, and a lot of people might take that, like, that's a that's a, that's a good offer.A better offer would be buy nine months, get nine months free, \\[...1.0s\\] still 18 dollars. A crazy offer would be by 6 months, get 12 months free for 18 dollars. In all three situations, they get 18, 18 months for 18 dollars.That's what it works. Everyone pays the same price for the same amount of service, but the third option will be the most compelling because it has the most free stuff, so \\[...0.4s\\] importance points \\[...1.2s\\] by XQY free gets people to buy more stuff and provides more value.So it used to take a whole year for some of my service businesses to make the money to cash flow the acquisition.But if you do BI 6 get six, for example, on the front end to attract customers or as a, hey, it's our grand opening BI six months, get six months, you can attract a boet of customers and get 6 months prepayments from all of them at full price.Now guess what happens? If I have a full price or even a higher than full price thing that I add some little tiny differentiator during my grand opening special, which allows me to say that this service was higher than what I would then normally offer later. Then it justifies me having an even higher price.So when I say buy six, get six, I might just get prepayments \\[...0.4s\\] at basically the full price for the year, because I added this extra wrinkle in. That's very high margin for me.So for a gym, I might say you get text access to me, which, by the way, I probably \\[...0.4s\\] would give all my first customers anyways, I just wouldn't promise that in the sale. I might for grand opening, so \\[...0.8s\\] raise prices were giving stuff away to preserve profits.Obviously, if you \\[...0.4s\\] can only afford a certain amount of margin, then don't give away your merch. That's just like my big obvious disclaimer now. Buy XQY free works better if you have more free stuff than paid stuff.Alright, so give away, give more free than you ask people to buy. Just play with the pricing until it makes sense for you. So buy one, get two instead of buy two to get one. So these are the same economics, \\[...0.9s\\] but this one's stronger. \\[...1.4s\\] That's how it works.Okay, now the free things can be different from the paid things, so this is key, so you just wanna make sure that the free stuff still makes the offer compelling.Let's say that \\[...0.4s\\] socks have a 10 dollar value. If they buy one shirt for 10 bucks, but get 20 dollars of free socks, it may seem like a better deal. Now alternatively, \\[...0.4s\\] here if we're looking at, like, buy one, let's say shirts or 20 bucks.If I say buy one shirt for 20 and get another shirt free, that may seem like less valuable than buy one shirt, get two pairs of socks free. Because what someone's gonna translate it into is buy one thing, get two things free \\[...0.4s\\] versus buy one thing, get one thing free.Now this is a testable proposition in some, some offers. Two pairs of socks may convert better than one shirt, depending on if the way that, that buyer buys, the next logical thing they would need would be socks. So more \\[...0.4s\\] free, cheaper things can work better than fewer free expensive things.Okay, so let's say I could only afford to give one shirt away for free. But now the same for the same cost, I give 3 pairs of socks, I would probably test buy one sure, get one shirt \\[...0.4s\\] versus buy one sure, get 3 socks \\[...0.4s\\] for free.And even though the socks cost less than a shirt, it still buy one get three, and sometimes that can works better. So I test this, rather than offer a 33% discount, try buy one get two free. This \\[...0.7s\\] here will convert more than this, but they're still 1/3 \\[...0.6s\\] off.Alright, so I just like to, if you are gonna use a discount, this structure still makes a discount even more compelling. Do not make offers like this if you cannot manage money, especially with service businesses. So if you say buy 6 months of service, get 6 months free.If you don't know how to manage money, and you immediately blow the money that they prepaid, \\[...0.4s\\] you're a bad business owner. So you need to be able to consistently, like, if you have to have an accountant, you know, do this for you.Put all the cash into one bank account, and you can pay yourself out of that bank account every month as you deliver services. But the worst thing you can possibly do for your reputation is, like, pre sell a year of service.And then, \\[...0.6s\\] you know like, do not do this play if you are trying to keep your business alive, if you need this cash in order to keep the business alive, I think you risk your reputation by doing it. I also cap this \\[...0.5s\\] at 10% of a recurring customer base for those you have recurring revenue businesses.So if you wanna do a banger, buy X get y free, which is a really great cash play. Let's save 100 recurring customers, cap it at ten. Don't let more than 10 of your recurring customers prepay for the year, cause you still. Like, \\[...0.4s\\] this is a, not a math solution.This is a psychological solution. I've just seen way more businesses succeed by keeping their recurring cash flow, because most businesses are honestly can't manage it. Now mathematically, it makes sense to get everybody on annual, \\[...0.5s\\] but \\[...0.6s\\] a lot of people can't handle that responsibility. Just be really honest with you.Okay, \\[...0.7s\\] so this is a great grand opening strategy \\[...0.6s\\] as a reference earlier. Um, this is also a great offer to give for fast cash now.If your business is healthy, but you're like, you know what? I wanna buy a bunch of equipment, \\[...0.7s\\] great \\[...0.6s\\] prepaid 10 people go buy your equipment, or you need to go buy a another big oven, industrial oven for your baking business. Like, totally makes sense for you to do prepaiments and things like that to cash or fund rather than take on credit ones.Super smart. Um, so even if customers prepay, you can still upsell them different stuff now. So this is really important. So I made this mistake, which is why I share with you \\[...0.7s\\] the people who prepay, especially for services for durations of time.Business owners have this fear of selling them or making offers for other stuff.But here's the craziest thing that we saw is that the people who prepay for the year are the most likely people to buy more stuff afterwards. And so these are basically a way of identifying your hyper buyers, and so they self select.They prepay for a year, and guess what happens after that? When I would have big booty bootcamp and a deadlift seminar, or, you know uh, make your sexy back, or I would do buns and guns or whatever else I would do.Lean by Halloween, they were the most likely people to pay, cause guess what? They weren't paying anything for being there. As far as they felt they, they had paid so long ago, they forgot that they paid, so it felt like I was just a free gym, and you know what?The cool thing about wallets with people who make money, they replenish, \\[...0.6s\\] and then you can ask again. So if customers only by once, this is just a disclaimer for the, um, \\[...0.5s\\] for the boot business.The reason they structured their deal that way was to maximize the transaction. So if you're in a business where people only buy once, then it makes sense to structure as much into that first sale as you can. Cause you're only gonna get one shot.Like, the bachelor parties are probably not coming back to Nashville now. Maybe they will, but \\[...0.5s\\] for the most part, that's this you wanna make the big to ask as big as you can.If you're looking at one shop summarizing by XQY Free in, by XQY free customers buy something to get other stuff for free by XQ Free works \\[...0.7s\\] for stuff that makes sense to buy more of or get longer access to \\[...0.6s\\] basic buy.XQY free offers reframe pricing, buy 1, get 2 free cost the same as buying 3 except customer C, the free offer as more valuable.Remember the 18 months service example I gave. So always try to give more free things than paid things. And you compare different free things with paid things as well, which you can just test. Alright, so buy XY freaking lengthen the amount of time customer stay.If normal customer stay for 3 months, then buy to get to customers will keep them for 4 months.So whatever you sell, try to extend, whatever the normal customer duration is by saying saying, like, if I know customer stay for 3, I do buy two get two, and I price it so that it's still four. I make more money, I make 33% more money.It's a great deal. Uh, if you use Bioskit y to generate a lot of cash fast, make sure you manage it, you can deliver on your promises. If you need fast cash, and your business is healthy, make sure make this offer to existing customers, uh, and just cap how many you sell to.If you have recurring, I recommend 10% as the cap. Um, keep selling customers who prepay for long durations, because they are the most likely people to buy again. With that being said, that is by XQY free. \\[...0.1s\\]"

He just did it because no one was allowed to pitch at this event, and she said, hey, if you wanna find out more, you can just go, you know, over there and whatever.And so \\[...0.3s\\] the thing is they weren't a lot of sell, but at that moment I wanted to buy, and I Learned later that that thing was called a webinar, and I thought that was really cool.And so that was more or less how I found out that I could attend something for free and then wanna buy something afterwards.So I call this free conception to upsell. So the reason this is a little bit different is that the promise of the attraction offer is to get people and then liquidate the acquisition, because there's a delay here.It like, \\[...0.8s\\] it was Lucy goosey, \\[...0.4s\\] not that you can't look great within 30 days, so you can again, this is why I was like, anyways, it's a bonus for you guys.Alright, so let's get in the description, so I'll show this image real quick.

That's how it works fundamentally.You're selling \\[...0.5s\\] or giving away \\[...0.8s\\] a selling tool now \\[...0.9s\\] effective selling tools also provide value. Bad selling tools are just pitches. Don't do that, \\[...0.5s\\] let's dive it. So \\[...0.7s\\] you give the free thing that teaches and provides value. It breaks beliefs that most people have around that particular thing.And so the more knowledgeable you are about your customer or your prospects, the more you can systematically break their beliefs around \\[...0.6s\\] the opportunity that you have or whatever service you provide that people get hung up on.So think about this is like FAQ zone steroids, and you want to make an offer that solves their next concern or have embedded CTAs or cost to action to take the next steps in the process.By the way, \\[...0.4s\\] if you're watching this massive video trading and you want to scale your business, we're pretty good at it.And so one, if you're really big business, you can go to acquisition. Com and hit the \\[...0.4s\\] sell button, and we'd love to look your business to invest in. If you're a smaller business, call it less than 10 million a year, then hit the scale button and we'd love to help you scale from a million a month to beyond$1 million a month. That's an embedded CTA. That's how that works.Alright, and this works for books, webinars, VSLS, events, workshops, video trainings like this, anything where you get people's undivided attention.Now \\[...0.4s\\] what this does is the process reverse engineers trust. The best way for someone to know that they're going to get value from you when they pay you is to give them value before they pay you. Mind blowing.I know. And so I believe that education is that the core of advertising. It's the core of marketing is that you help people shift their belief around something so that they make a decision to buy.And so the amount of time that you need is in direct proportion to the price of the thing you sell, how cool the audience is and what that price is relative to their buying power.So for example, if I'm selling consumers, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, if I have a 20 dollar thing, I might be able to sell that in a seven second ad \\[...0.8s\\] direct to purchase. If I sell a 7,000 dollar thing, I might also be able to sell that off of 30 second ad to a \\[...0.4s\\] 50 million dollar year business owner.So it depends. It's the price relative to their buying power. But if you're selling a 500 dollar thing, if it's a physical product, maybe you can get it off of an ad. Most likely above that, you start having to add in phone sales and things like that in order to close deals.Now \\[...0.3s\\] to be clear, it is my belief that every customer needs a certain amount of information to buy. And so Tesla, for example, sells their cars on the internet.You can buy the car online. And so with enough brand \\[...0.8s\\] goodwill \\[...0.5s\\] and enough people making that are aware of the products and the reviews that you've had, the word of mouth, \\[...0.3s\\] you can \\[...0.3s\\] facilitate a 30, 50 hundred thousand dollar plus sale with zero salespeople.But \\[...0.9s\\] for every person that opts in on the Tesla site, if they also had 1,000 people calling all the people who didn't follow through the purchase, they would make even more money.And so the idea is that marketing gets as many people over the line as you can, and for everybody who's not over the line, sales fills the gaps. But it's not that sales and marketing are different.They are the same continuum. And so this free consumption thing is basically just zooming more people along. Think about it, like microwaving the prospect. So it's like in two days you go from I don't know who this guy is to I absolutely trust them. And so I Learned this from \\[...0.7s\\] some interview I heard, uh, from \\[...0.5s\\] the sounds bad, but a guy who had a Ponzi scheme, uh, for investments.But I, I still, I love understanding what they do for persuasion, because they use great skills for evil, we wouldn't use those great skills for good.And so he found that he could get someone to invest many, many millions of dollars with him within four hours. And I thought that, that was fascinating. Uh, just it again, it depends on the prospect.Who, who are we talking to, right, if you don't have$1 million, then you would have no idea, but that's, it really depends on who you're talking to. Alright, so I like to use this analogy of the bigger the plane, the longer the runway.And so if you wanna sell a really expensive thing relative to what someone has in terms of money, you're gonna need to longer in order to earn their trust. People don't sell time shares off of a free ebook. They do \\[...0.5s\\] by telling them to fly down for a cruise for 7 days.And at the end of the 7 days they get them by all sorts of stuff. Right? Because after that period of time, they trust you.So that is the description. That is how it works. That's why we do it. Now let me use some examples. So this was a really common one that happens in the \\[...0.3s\\] chiropractor space. So they have the diabetic dinners, neuropathy \\[...0.3s\\] XYZ dinners. They give these free dinners away.So they sometimes they do steak dinners right? And so what they do is they have a 90 minute presentation during a three hour dinner that sells a$50 to a hundred dollar console.Which sounds like why would you waste that time after they come in for the console they then sell, they made 5,000, 10,000 dollar year long health and wellness program with supplements and nutrition protocols to go with it.And so the benchmarks there are you convert 25% of the room into the 50, 200 dollar thing and then you convert 1/3 of the people who show up for the appointment into the 5 to 10,000 R thing.So you do the math there. Basically you're converting some of the neighborhood like 10 ish percent, um, of the people \\[...0.4s\\] who show up \\[...0.4s\\] for the dinner \\[...0.4s\\] fundamentally end up buying the expensive thing. So if you have 100 people shop for the dinner and you sell 10 at 10 k, you make 100 grand for dinner.This is super common in the education space. So there's these three to five day challenges, these virtual summits, things like that. And so these are, you know, day 1 you give, day 2 you give slash ask, day 3 you re pitch, slash give. That is the very standard structure.And so in the challenge structure it's give, give, give, pitch, re pitch with proof. If you have a very high ticket price, you can push people to a phone call from the 5 day thing to get someone to finalize the transaction, get details from a salesperson.And so the goal of these challenges, these events, these multi day things, these dinners is to break the core beliefs of the prospect while you deliver on the tactical promise that you made at the beginning and or the headline of the promotion you had.The benchmark that I have if it's virtual is that you convert 2 to 5% of people who Oct in, not his schedule show everything down, but just if you say I got 1,000 options for my virtual thing, if I can convert, uh, 2% of those people \\[...0.3s\\] at a, \\[...0.3s\\] you know, expensive price, then I will offset the cost. Now if you're like, wait, mine's not you.It depends by market, but if you're going really mass market, really cheap opt ins, it's 2 to 5%.If you're in a super niche, it should be way harder than that. That's the, basically, that's the worst numbers you can have. It only gets better if you have more brand, more warm audience and more, uh, more niche down in terms of what, what you're selling and who you're selling to.So this is an example, something I look like, so on Monday and again you can compress this. Like, you could make this into one day rather than five days.It all just like, this is basically the, \\[...0.4s\\] the, the stuff that's going to get covered typically in a process. This could be a 90 minute video. Everything's just about how much and how many examples you're gonna give.So Monday, it's like our story, why it's like your story, why we can help, what we're gonna cover in our perspective shift about how your approach to solving problems is different, how our \\[...0.7s\\] approach is different than what you've had before.Tuesday is gonna be second valuable negative value, which is regarding their ability or insecurity. It's like, what are they most afraid of?What are the thing that they're most concerned about? The next one is gonna be the second thing that they're also concerned about. This is typically an excuse outside of themselves.So that's like, uh, one is, I don't think I can do it. Something is this, other thing is going to block me from doing it.Alright, the next one is gonna be, you mention your core offers gonna be coming the next day, and then of course, you pitch, and then you re pitch with some sort of Q\\&A which you add more proof in.That's when you invite past successtories on you, do many case studies, and then you restock the offer. Alright, so this is fundamentally how it works.Now \\[...0.9s\\] if you're a beginner, this is like a, this is flashing Vegas lights okay, \\[...1.0s\\] we, so by the time you're seeing this, we should have done a big school \\[...0.4s\\] launch \\[...0.4s\\] for people. This is more or less what I teach all the beginners to do. And you're like, wait, I thought it was complex.If you wanna do it at scale, it's complex. If you wanna do it one on one, it's the simplest way to sell.So hear me out, \\[...1.6s\\] you could do this \\[...0.7s\\] with one person at a time. And so you could say, hey, instead of calling it a 3 to five day challenge, say I will spend five days with you, doesn't have to be full days, can be five one hour sessions. You get five hours of my time to help you get this goal \\[...0.4s\\] in circle.On the first day, you're going to frame the fact that you're gonna make an offer at the end, you say, hey, before you get going, is it okay if at the end of this whole thing, um, I just make an offer what it would look like to work with me long term? If they say no, then don't do the rest of it.Right, \\[...0.5s\\] but during that process, you should understand what their goals are, what the reasons that the obstacles have gotten the way for them, um, \\[...0.5s\\] and basically all the friction that they've had to deal with, uh, in the past.This is basically like a closure framework clarify with their label and problem over their past pain. And then sell them the vacation of the vacation being what we're gonna cop together in the next 5 days. Uh, explain away whatever their concerns are reinforced decision, and then you frame the sale. Alright, sorry, that was fast, you can watch it again on slow.That's what you would do on the first day, the next two, you know, two, three days whatever it is. Uh, you then overcome the main beliefs that they're gonna have about the things that are gonna stop them.You're gonna show them one on one, and at the end, you say, hey, \\[...0.7s\\] ask for referral, anybody else who, so you can recap it, hey, was this great? Then you can ask for other people who would like to go through this free thing with you. And then finally you can make your offer.Hey, remember that thing I, I told you about the get you mind if I tell you about it now, now if you're a super beginner, you can just ask him, \\[...0.4s\\] what do you think working with me for 3,000 hours per year would look like to you?Then they can tell you the offer, and then you can say, yeah, that sounds good, let's do that.Right, if you have no idea, if you have 20 of those conversations, you're gonna have a pretty decent idea, and then you can start making the offer. So this is the \\[...0.5s\\] easiest way, because if you suck at sales, it's way easier to sell when you spend five hours with someone building, building value.This is exactly what I did when I started my first business, is I told people to donate \\[...0.4s\\] 500, do \\[...0.3s\\]$1,000 to the charity their choice.And I worked with them for 12 weeks. Those 12 weeks was one time a week for the 12 weeks, and then I, you know, pitched them in the end for, for staying more stuff now I Learned. Now I should have pushed them halfway through, and I probably could have done it in six weeks. Lots of things I Learned.And so here there's just X amount of time you need to spend, and you can microwave it with the prospect. You can just do it in five days rather than five weeks by just compressing the time period.So these are might be headlines for whatever your free thing is, just like, free find your Perfect Product Entrepreneurship Challenge. So you could say if you're a beginner, hey, I'll spend 5 hours with you, help you find your perfect product. \\[...1.3s\\]What happens when someone has the perfect product? They're gonna wanna learn how to advertise it, we're gonna learn how to put it on a website, they're gonna learn how to, \\[...0.3s\\] how to manage inventory, all the other things to go with it.When you solve one problem, you create others, \\[...0.5s\\] which you can solve in exchange for money. And they will believe you, because you fulfilled your first promise. If you're marketing agency, you can be free five day find your niche aces Jones.Like, if I was trying to help people start agencies, a lot of people like, who do I sell to? It's a guy, by the end of the five days, you're gonna know exactly who you're gonna sell to. What else you gonna need?You learn how to generate lead, you learn how to sell, you gotta learn how to pry all these other things, and so each of these things \\[...0.6s\\] a lead magnet fundamentally with this is, is a big lead magnet \\[...0.3s\\] that gets people to opt in.And because it's in a short time period, people like the fact that it's fast, they're gonna get this result. You can increase their perceive, like, achievement by saying it's 1:01. You can \\[...0.8s\\] add scale by adding technology and virtual summits and more automations and things like that.And at the, the Max, Max leverage version of this is you run these things on autopilot every hour, and everything is automated and personalized to the person.That's what the businesses that do$100 million a year are doing. \\[...1.0s\\] But if you're starting out, you don't have to worry about sharp rates, cause you can just text the people and see what time they wanna meet.All right, you make this very easy \\[...1.0s\\] weight loss, uh, a plateau buster. You basically walk through a 5 day plateau buster. What they need to do for eating and drinking and whatever else addiction. Five days to substance free challenge pain, 5 day pain release life coach, 5 days to get unstuck.It doesn't matter whatever it is, you can usually deliver a tremendous amount of value in five hours of time or \\[...0.4s\\] 90 minutes times five of time. And this works. So the reason, if you're like, man, why didn't you put this in the book?Cause it's really long, and there's a lot of stuff to it. Alright, and so webinars are an example of this is just compressed \\[...0.4s\\] into 90 minutes. So instead of, you know, day one, day two day three, like, day one is origin story which you just put in the first 15 minutes.Day two is the big obstacle that most people are gonna county, put that \\[...0.7s\\] in the next 15 minutes. You basically chunk your way down to 60 minutes, 45 to 60 minutes being the, kind of, the value piece, and then the next 30 being the pitch with the stack, everything else.Alright, so the benchmark for most webinars is converting 10% of the people who show up live.Alright, strategy call, \\[...0.3s\\] uh, this is one where I wanna be really clear. A lot of people have kind of butchered the idea of a strategy call because all sales calls are just considered strategy calls now. But \\[...0.7s\\] you can relieve. You can get this by telling people that you will not ask for their card on the phone.And this works \\[...0.3s\\] very sexily. Um, if you mean it, \\[...0.3s\\] and then what you do is you just use your qualification call \\[...0.7s\\] as a strategy call. And so you do qualify what problems they have, and you should be able to pry value in terms of clarifying what next things are concerning their business, whatever it is.If it's a B to B offer, it's B to C offer it's what thing is preventing them from hitting their calls. And at that point you would then be able to reasonably and ethically qualify them for a sales call.But now at that point, you have provided value and then you can make the offer, just being hop on a call with the sales guy. Now you wouldn't say that you'd say this is John, John's amazing, he cured cancer, and he, \\[...0.4s\\] you also have cancer.Don't do any of that, but you get that is you wanna edify the salesman \\[...0.4s\\] and say that he's how people just like them get to where they wanna go.And you wanna ideally tie that to people who've done that recently using this specific system. And for this, you wanna convert 25% or more of the people who hit on these calls.All right, important points, so, uh, the three beliefs that we always have to overcome with every single sale, no matter what is people point to circumstances, they say life should be easy and it isn't, and they get upset about it.And so, it's like, I don't have the money, which is circumcising, cause it means that they're not being resourceful. They say, I don't have the time when really, really, it just means that they're not prioritizing it.It was the same amount of time. And so we have to get them to take the finger of blame and point towards themselves and say, it's up to me. It's not about my circumstances. It's about my ability to be resourceful, my ability to prioritize.Right? And so that is what belief number one you have to break for people as it's not the outside world, it's me. Alright. The next one is, uh, other people should treat me the way I want them to be treated. Everyone should do what I tell them to.That doesn't happen. And so we have to say, you are actually the one responsible for your own life. And so it's not your business partner, it's not your spouse, it's not your dog, it's not your grandma, it's not your employees, it's you who are the one who were in control.And so instead of asking for permission, you need to be asking for support. And so that's fundamentally the belief that we have to help the break in this thing that other people are gonna stop them.So if someone says, oh, I wouldn't be able to do this thing because of my kids, we have to basically reorient that, say, hey, this is actually how it's gonna help your kids. Hey, I can't do this because of my spouse. Actually it's gonna help your relations with your spouse. We have to reframe what they say and that would be the second big belief.The third big belief is gonna be self, which is I can't do this. I'm afraid, \\[...0.4s\\] right, what happens if I fail? And so we want to get them to confront the decision, give them the variables that it takes to make a logical decision and make them feel that this is actually decision that is not rushed at all. It's something that they've been making a long time ago.Today is just the first day they're taking action on it. \\[...1.5s\\] And so \\[...0.4s\\] 1, breaking beliefs. You wanna teach concepts, not tactics. This is a big mess up. And most people do when they have this free value thing. The reason is that everyone gets value from concepts, only executors get value from tactics. \\[...1.3s\\]So \\[...0.4s\\] summary, learn how to break the beliefs, which, by the way, the way you break a belief is you say, this is what you used to believe, this is why it's wrong, this is what's right, this is why it's right proof.5 steps, \\[...0.6s\\] this is what you believe, this is why it's wrong, this is what's right, this is why it's right proof. So \\[...0.3s\\] provide excessive value teaching concepts that underpin whatever you sell.This is an education process to create your ideal prospect and ward off \\[...0.4s\\] people who are not your ideal prospect. So if you get people in, and you're like, oh, I'm losing people. If they are the right people, that's bad.If they're the wrong people, that's good. And these can be added to any sales process in any business to increase close rates \\[...0.3s\\] and the average ticket sold.And so there's a zillion ways to do this, so I'll explain it like, this is that once you can create educational products, if you will, that you would give away for free. You can insert them.So if you have multiple sales in a process between call 1 and call 2, you can give them a video. If you want them to watch something prior to getting on a call, before call 1, you can force them to watch a video. You can have someone watch five videos before they talk to you.Like, all of this is just how much friction do we want, uh, how little friction do we need to provide to get people to buy? We wanna have as much as needed, but no more. And there you are already made my, my CTA for you, but you can go to acquisition. Com if you want to grow your business.But that's my, my cutesy way of doing that being said that completes free with consumption and \\[...0.3s\\] our attraction offers section. Now we move on to up so offers"

I've been a continuity guy my whole life, and so this is a section that I hold near due to my heart has made me a tremendous amount of money. It also stabilizes the cashful business.And so in our four money models, we have attraction upsells, downsells and now Kaboom continuity. So continuity offers provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing payments for until they cancel. They boost the profit from every customer and give you one last thing to sell.Continuity offers are awesome because you sell once and get paid again and again and again. So here's my quick explanation. Let's say you offer something for$1,000 to 100 people and 10 people buy. You make$10,000 \\[...0.4s\\] ten times a thousand dollars.Okay, now let's say that you talk to the same hundred people, but you make your thousand dollar thing$50 a month instead and at 50 bucks when get 40 out of the hundred to buy. And if you keep those people for 20 months, you still make$1,000 from each customer.So you go from making$10,000 now and zero dollars over time$2,000 now and$40,000 over time. And as an added bonus, in the first example, if you only sold 10 customers, you'd only have 10 customers to upsell later.If you use a continuity offer and sold 40 customers, you'd have four times the customers to upsell later, which is a massive difference.This is fundamentally why people do continuity. You can sell more people at a lower price, you can still collect the same LTV, and you get four times the customers to upsell later.The pros are you can shock more customers compared to something more expensive. The cons are but you make way less money now, which makes it tough to use as an attraction offer on its own, which is why we put it last, or at least why I tend to put it last.So the TLDR is that by making continuity offers last, we get the best of all worlds. We get cash today from attraction offers, upsell offers and downsell offers. And we get a little cash today and tons of cash tomorrow from continuity offers.Note to be clear, you can make continuity offers \\[...0.4s\\] whenever and however you want. There are no rules. Alright, they can attract new customers up, selling downs on current customers or reengage all customers same as all the others.So the objective here, 4 continuity offers within the money models that I explained is to maximize lifetime value per customer. These have lower absolute gross profit but higher gross margins often times.There are three topics we will cover down, so the upsell calcuting back of NEFC LTV and big head long tail.So let's rock through it. So down, so the upsell, so this is my ￠2 I found it works best to down sell your up sell so get more cash up front sell shorter duration and then add value and then sell it for less alright so when I explain this I had my$16,000 16 week thing thousand dollars a week and then I would say hey let me give you five times the value \\[...0.4s\\] and then \\[...0.5s\\] it's less and people like whoa but I extended the term so that's how I downsold my upsell a lot of times people want to increase the price of the upsell there's nothing wrong with that this is just an alternative method that I found worked really well my challenges in the beginning was$600 for six weeks and then back in we sell$200 per month so it's less so one is$100 a week one$50 a week it's half the price and as a member you get all these benefits right and so I like the down sell the upsell process because if they said yes to this thing they're like oh this is even better deal and then we convert even more of them alright so here's how it sounds so have you enjoyed everything so far they say yes mind if I tell you about a way to save a little bit and get a lot more they say yes you say so given you've enjoyed X y and Z we want you here for the long term so here's what we're gonna do if you're in this with us for the long term we wanna reward you with even more stuff and do it for less you in great that's the sale it's very straightforward so people think about monthly cash flow more than they think about duration so we had three or contracts so the total contract value was way higher in the 16 weeks but the monthly payment was significantly lower and so this is the power of commitments and contracts it can significantly increase LTV if you deliver value so that's down so the up so \\[...0.4s\\] now let's talk about cat leading back of neck and LTV so \\[...0.8s\\] the simplest way to do this is look at your price divided by your monthly turn and that gives you your lifetime revenue remember we still have margin on this we still have some cost of delivery now the gross margin times lifetime revenue equals your lifetime gross profit so for example let's say our price minus our cost of goods times 100% equals our gross margins so let's say we have 100 dollar price 20 dollar cost of goods times 100= 80% gross margins okay so now we take our 80% gross margins we multiply by our lifetime revenue and we get$800 of lifetime gross profit that's how much we make per customer over lifetime that is what you can calculate for yourself given whatever it is you have so you \\[...0.4s\\] divide your price by your turn that gives you the revenue then you basically just figure out what your gross margin is multiply that by that and there you go so getting people into continuity automatically extends LTB even with a company that does one time transactions most recurring stuff that has basically no added value I'm just being super real with you \\[...0.5s\\] the recurring is usually 3 months which still 3 extra glcb so if you sell physical products which maybe have one time use if you just get someone inscription it usually triples the value of the customer \\[...0.4s\\] so \\[...0.4s\\] if half the people do that thing then you've got half the people doing 3 x and half them doing 1 x which means you double the revenue of your business not bad just by making it available so the valuable money lesson is people think more about price than they do about term they think more what they have to pay today now what they're gonna have to pay tomorrow \\[...0.4s\\] to extend ltgp just to give you an example here if you have that hundred dollar per month thing and you have 10% turn your lifetime \\[...0.4s\\] revenue would be a thousand bucks if you go from 100 dollars divided by 3% turns you go from 10% to 3% you have a 3,000 dollar lifetime revenue \\[...0.6s\\] massive so some people like oh it's only decreasing turn by \\[...0.5s\\] you know 7% now you decreased it by 70% or 300 sorry 300% in terms of what it is \\[...0.4s\\] all right and so turn is how many customers leave monthly from the ones who started the month by percentage so if you want big ltgp \\[...0.6s\\] conquer turn \\[...0.4s\\] make this number the people who cancel every month go down and the amount that you make from that is unbelievable so bats back of napkin altivate so now let's talk about big head long tail so John told me this he said you can shear sheep \\[...0.5s\\] let's just say sheep you can share shape you can share sheep for a lifetime but you can only skin it once and so he explained this one thing to me that I have always remembered he said you know I had this membership by 10 salon that was$100 down than 10 bucks a month he said or you could just pay 1999 a month he said the he said people would call him up before their cards would expire to make sure they got to save that 10 dollar month thing and so because they felt like they had bought that lower rate they didn't wanna lose it and so that concept of the big head long tail came from John like if you pay$1,000 and then something's$50 a month afterwards the likely that you wanna cancel that's way lower \\[...0.4s\\] and so if you say hey you can pay a thousand bucks now and then you can earn this lower rate or \\[...0.4s\\] you can pay$200 a month a lot of you were like \\[...0.5s\\] shit I'll just pay a grand and then keep the 50 but the thing is is that 50 the churn on that 50 so low that you even make more over time than the$200 a month so you have to play with the numbers here but typically the more offset the offfront versus the continuity the more valuable it is and I will do one little side quest here and then we'll get into them I think the main reason that a lot of education businesses in media businesses do not have good continuity is because the price to values mismatched if I \\[...0.7s\\] teach you arithmetic the day before you learn arithmetic it's unbelievably valuable you you learn you will be able to do mathematics in the world how valuable is that the day after you learn arithmetic you getting a course on arithmetic is vet worth nothing and so the problem is that a lot of media and education businesses will take that continuity concept that I talked about earlier like well I could sell way more people but the problem is that the value diminishes precipitously with information because once you've Learned something you've Learned it you've gotten you've extracted the values and so the way that I like to think about this is that \\[...0.6s\\] either you sell bulk payments upfronts you sell annual memberships which I'm obviously a big fan of or \\[...0.8s\\] you can sell one time prices for things that deliver one time value and then you'd have much lower continuity for things that deliver ongoing value and so you basically break apart the things that are one time value versus consumable value I'll give you an example so in Jim watch we had um \\[...0.8s\\] the \\[...0.4s\\] sale system once you install the sale system you have the sale system okay got it so that would be one time value something that would be recurring value or consumable value but would be \\[...0.6s\\] calls with uh one of our business consultants who's gonna make sure that you're tweaking the things in your business and look at the metros every single month having access to the new plays or new releases that were released every single month that's something that's consumed every single month cause it's new if we had new ads that we were going to test and run to make sure they were winners then every month you're like why want the new ads so those are things that are consumable so it makes sense to price \\[...0.4s\\] the payment plan or the continuity based on the value of those consumables not the blended value of the one time thing in the consumable because that blended value would be much higher and would have a much higher \\[...0.4s\\] likelihood of turn and so this is how I would prefer to fix most education business is nothing wrong like they often have high turn simply cause they're miss priced they kind of try to price in the middle when really should price way high up front and lower overtime or alternatively just charge annual and then that way you're just basically looking back into the future and say hey if a year from now you can do all these things would that be valuable yes and then you have a whole year to figure out what the next big thing you're gonna basically buys you more time to figure out the next \\[...0.8s\\] offer you're gonna make them \\[...0.4s\\] that \\[...0.6s\\] the first offer you did solved so if I taught you how to sell then maybe you wanna have learn how to market if I taught you to sell maybe you wanna learn how to onboard there's gonna still be the same offer solution cycle that exist and you can still include that within the continuity that you have so real word offer so let's say you$5,000 down 200 bucks a month this also do the big head long tail helps with client finance acquisition because you have this big up from payment you can offset the cost your car customers \\[...0.4s\\] offset your sales commissions and then you get the continuity and the nice thing here is the cancellation rate is very very low because of some cost fallacy people don't wanna lose money they put down so it's very unlikely someone's$5,000 down and then cancels month two enterprise value is based on a discount applied to future cash flows which really comes down to how much money and how likely is it to occur and so for you to have a very big business you want lots of money that's gonna have in the future that's very likely that gives you a big multiple on the value of your business if you have very little money it's very unlikely to occur then it's a small multiple or none at all so this features into how likely will we \\[...0.4s\\] retain customer retain customers retain revenue and have that increase over time this is where continuity becomes more guy this is again this is not in the book so this is me giving you bonus stuff um there's a difference between recurring and reoccurring revenue so Netflix is recurring think memberships Coca Cola is reoccurring I am a Coca Cola product buyer I buy lots of their drinks and I do that on a regular basis but I don't have a fixed membership but I reoccur both are great the key with this one is that you just need to demonstrate that hey I for example there's a sauce company that I like and I bought I bought their sauce for like four straight years and I use it every single I go through three or four bottles a month and I've been using four years and sure as hell you can bet that they can calculate that the Irish person buys a bottle overtime buys another 20 bottles that makes it a very valuable business \\[...0.4s\\] company 1 let's say this got topline of$10 million Ibada 3 company 2 is 10 million and 3 million Ibada okay this one's all transactional you might get a forex multiple this is all recurring and based on how much you retain it it might be worth 8 to 15 times so it's 24 to 45 million so between 12 and 24 to 45 that's a hell of a lot more money so this is problems worth solving and so if they stay buyers will pay and when I say buyers I mean investors so my personal note is that you sleep grade this me telling you personally when you know on the 1st the month that all your bills are paid and your profits are already locked in and everything else you have is gravy and so recurring continuity equals stability which is why it's the fourth pillar of this it's also the thing that will usually make your company the most vibe so how I sold you hopefully on adding some recurring element to your business \\[...0.6s\\] great so let's get to the three best combinations that I've seen in used continuity bonus offers continuity discount offers and then the wave fee offer all right \\[...0.4s\\] so let's rock and roll and now we do bonus offer  \n\\[...2.1s\\]So we just covered the intro to con duty offers and why con duty offers will make your business more viable. They will stabilize cash flow, they can sell more customers that you potentially upsell in the future, and they give you one last thing to sell.Now we start into continuity bonus offer, which one of my favorite continuity offer structures. So here's how I Learned it. I saw this ad that said, I'm giving away all my courses for free, and I was like, that's insane.What's the catch? And so I had bought some of this guy's courses, so I knew that the courses, the price points that he was selling before were the legit prices. And so \\[...0.4s\\] for me to buy all of them at once, it would have been$24,000. He said, or \\[...0.5s\\] you can just get a free trial \\[...1.1s\\] of my 399 dollar month. These are.So I get the first three days free and I get all of this stuff \\[...0.8s\\] just for trying it. And I was like, wow, what a deal.Then on the thank you page, it said, or \\[...0.4s\\] you can pay today \\[...0.6s\\] for 2\\. 99 a month \\[...0.6s\\] and \\[...0.4s\\] you get just the, all the back news letters \\[...0.5s\\] that I've done up to this point. If you do this \\[...0.9s\\] and you get to lock in this two 99 a month for life. This is also a lifetime discount. This is a combination.So \\[...0.6s\\] one of my team asked me, they're like, man, I'm thinking about all the different businesses that I've seen and something that's like combination of this and this. It's like yeah, that's 100% the point.These are as narrow down as I could focus them so that I could kind of teach or break down each of the concepts, but these absolutely mix and match. You absolutely can do when you're midnight back into a rollover offer, into a continuity bonus that also has some lifetime discount components to it. Like there's \\[...0.4s\\] unlimited variations.And that's the joy of this. This is what I love when I'm building a money model for businesses, taking the, the Lego pieces and putting them together, I mean like, wow, look, if we did this, we get this percentage here, look how much we can extend LTV. That's the, that's where the real magic happens.But you can't build a building unless you learn how to lay a brick. So that's where we do it. Okay, so no, he didn't offer the 24,000 offer. He simply valued it \\[...0.6s\\] all right now when I saw that, I was like, that's a really cool offer.This is then when it happened in my world years later. So there was this gym owner that hopped on a call \\[...0.9s\\] and I was like, okay you know, tell me your numbers. And he was crushing everyone's numbers and I was like, dude, what are you doing?And he explained that he had a new way of getting members. And it wasn't that he had started offering a different front and offer in terms of his advertising. So he kept our ads, you get the copy, all that stuff was the same.But when people came in, he had a different way of kind of judo chopping how he would make the presentation. And so what he did was \\[...0.7s\\] he increased the price of his challenge. And so then he offered that thing after selling it to them as a free gift for just becoming a member.So remember I came from the gym world. We wanted to sell continuity at the end of the usual everyone to get into memberships, but thing is no one wants to buy a membership.That's the problem. And so we have to come up with 21 day transformations, 28 day transformation, six week challenges, all this stuff to get people in the door and then they realize if they work out, they feel good, they wanna do this for life. But people don't just come and sign up for memberships, not off it.And people get way better experience when you have some sort of like structure onboarding. And so what he did was he was like, huh, he said he did it by accident one time \\[...0.4s\\] and then he was like, oh my god, that went so easily, which by the way, is how most of the sales hit patients happen.Somebody came in \\[...0.4s\\] and he saw them on the challenge, but they couldn't afford it. And he said, you know what? I'll give you the challenge for free if you just sign up as a member.And they were like, oh, cool. And just like that, he figured he could take this really viable thing and get everyone in continuity by just giving it to them for free.And so by doing that, he was closing 70 to 80% of people walking the door, which is monster. And he was getting the sign up at full price and my personal benefit, there's this cool good wheel feeling of like, you know what, you want this really viable thing, I'll just give it to you as a gift.You sign up as a member and here are some benefits to becoming a member that you wouldn't even have if you bought this.So now let's get a description. So with continuity bonuses you give the customer an awesome thing if they sign up today. Typically the bonus itself, this is key, has more value than the first continuity payment. That's really all there is to it. So he offered this big 600, 800,000 dollar thing if you sign up for 200 dollars today.The first example with the newsletter thing, he offered this 24,000 dollar thing if you sign up for a trial of a 400 dollar month continuity.So bonus is adding value. And so for products, you can give away very small things or one big product that complements the subscription. For services, you can give away a \\[...0.4s\\] defined program onboarding setup or features that add value to the core service.All of those things would be things that you can give away as bodices forconnoity discounts are lowering costs, so remember that anything you offer for free can also be offered as a discount.Free stuff and discounts both affect how we make decisions. So we want to do both to get the benefits of both. When making continuity offers, I prefer to get people to start if I add more good stuff bonuses and take away bad stuff discounts. So that's how you do it. Add more good stuff, take away bad stuff, get more people to buy now to make it work better at urgency. Only they get that stuff if they join right now.Also, you can offer the bonus as a standalone purchase or you can only make it available if they buy your continuity. So either of them work.And I'm gonna show you some really cool math examples at the end of this video of price tests. We've run \\[...0.4s\\] to \\[...0.4s\\] generate more cash up front or more people taking continuity.So there's actually some signs I can show you of, like, how much cash you want up front first, how many people you want to take continuity, and then what percentage is the right percentage to offer. So you can get the right distribution you want. And we tested this across law location, so I feel pretty confident about it.So on their own \\[...0.4s\\] continuity offers get less cash now. Remember, less cash now, and that makes it tough for getting customers profitably. But the way that I use them, we can still hit our 30 day profit goals, which I'll explain in a second.So first, I do all my big cash attraction upsell and downsell offers, so I should already be profitable. I should already have cash from all these original offers. Then continuity offers get a little bit of cash from the first month's payments.Then I offer people who bought that one month a discount for prepaying more months. This further boost 30 day profits, giving me more cash to advertise \\[...0.4s\\] and stacks recurring revenue.So think about how that goes big attraction offer, buy XY free, win your money back, whatever, got it, then we do our up sales, got it, then we do our down cells, got it, then we get them into continuity, really soft pitch, we got him on continuity, we give him some bonuses in order to say, yes, now that they're on continuity, we already have the commitment.We then say, hey, you're already committed, let's just prepay and save some money. We stack even more cash forward, and that's how you just stack stack stack stack, stack you front load the money so that you can scale your advertising go to the moon.Alright, let's do some examples, so physical products, let's choose pet food, alright, so one time bonus get every dog toy you've ever made for free and 800 dollar value when you sign up for a monthly food shipments for 59 dollars a month.Now monthly bonuses, you'll also get a new dog toy every month as a member. Also cool. Then it's something else that I can give. So those are two different kind of bonus continuity offers that you can have. One is upfront to get them to buy, the others to get them to stay.Now service short term accelerator offer, so one time bonus \\[...0.4s\\] for the short term accelerator, it costs$1,000 on its own, get it free when you become a member for$100 a month.Same concept is the gym. The bonus package is the VIP community members enjoy first line access to events, longer support hours as in longer, not longer time period, \\[...0.6s\\] better sore poor reps and faster response times.So if you become a VIP member, not only do you get this big benefit, you also get this recurring benefit of continuing to pay and stay does your product offer.So one time bonus would be, uh, get all my past 40 newsletters valued at 15,800, whatever by becoming a member today for only three 99 a month after 30 day free trial \\[...0.4s\\] lifetime discount plus lifetime bonuses.If you pay today, you can lock in a lifetime discount for two 99 a month, and you get early digital access and a physical copy every month. Now important points focus on the bonus, not the membership. This is really important.Join my membership program isn't very compelling, not nearly as compelling as get this free valuable thing. So advertise the free valuable thing, then explain the rest of the offer once they show interest. So if I'm talking about the$800 of dog toys, I advertise my$300 dog toys, not my dog food.If I'm talking about my six week challenge, I'm talking about the six week challenge. They come in. I explain the thousand more thing I say, or you can get that whole thing and this other thing for less. That's the, it is you advertise the thing you're gonna give away, not the thing you sell.Bonuses, kind of work like up sales, more the same. You get two years of past newsletters by becoming a member. So they're coming in for newsletters, you get more of that thing \\[...0.4s\\] complimentary. You get nutrition services for free when you sign up for one of our fitness memberships.Great, it's complimentary, it goes together, you get an upgrade, which is better, right, you get a free gold membership when you buy a bonus membership. So it's limited availability, keep your bonuses related to your core offer.Okay, this is key, so \\[...0.5s\\] if the bonus that you give is too different, you will attract the wrong types of customers. So for instance, don't advertise a free T-shirt \\[...0.4s\\] to upsell tech services, that wouldn't make sense, but advertising a free T-shirt to upsell T-shirt printing makes sense.If I wanted to offer a free \\[...0.5s\\] fix or get out of jail free card for will fix something that's going wrong with your servers, that might be a great free bonus that I would give away. That makes sense to naturally, then upsell tech services \\[...0.5s\\] now make bonuses things you already have in do.Alright, so for instance, \\[...0.4s\\] the two past years of newsletters cost no extra time but are super high value. And onboarding is something that you have to do with a customer or client anyways. So you might as well slap a price on it and give it to him as a bonus. If you value it, they will too.And so again, the whole challenge thing that we created back in the day, the defined in programs which many service providers offer, they're usually fundamentally just fancy onboarding.So you can just make sure that people all go through this fancy onboarding, but you put a price associated with it. So then you get way more people to sign up for your continuity.Alright. So physical bonuses on digital products and digital bonuses with physical products. Alright, so if I have a digital membership, I might offer a hat, a shirt or tool or something else related to the offer.Now if I have a physical product or service like a boxing gym membership, offering livestream cesses can get more people to sign up. Also, if I have a digital thing, I might offer boxing gloves that I would give if they buy my digital membership.So criss crossing physical and digital, in my opinion, works exceptionally well.So this strategy often lowers the cost of getting a customer more than the cost the bonus. That's the point. And so even if someone, you know, takes the bonuses and then runs, we still typically get a lower overall cost.You car customers in general, we can still make it up on everyone else. If it gets too expensive, maybe shift your offer and then give that one a try. But more often than not, adding the bonus wool \\[...0.4s\\] in the long term net you way more money. Use realistic bonus pricings.The bigger the value anchor on your bonus, the more compelling the offer, but you also have to make the anchor believable.Alright, some business owners make up ridiculous values. Don't do that, it won't anchor the customer and you lose trust with them. So this is a great opportunity to give away products that you sold before in the past. So then you can anchor on their actual prices and use real discounts and bonuses.So, it's like, I used to sell this for two grand, and \\[...0.5s\\] here's receipts of me telling this to grin.Would you like it for free if you sign up for 200 bucks? A lot of people say yes to that, but that's ethical and it's real, and it's believable you can bonus customers by giving them titles. This is little clever.So you can give customers titles, uh, when they stay 3 months or 6 months or 12 months and beyond.So things like silver, gold, diamond, double diamond, etc. And so they get status in the community, and you can have some little frills and that they get some little bonuses that are associated with those titles.But the main thing is if they know that in two months, they're gonna get this, this upgrade and status that will, that can drag people through the continuity. And you can typically extend each time how long before you give them the next kind of reinforcing event.So in the beginning, maybe once they get to 90 days, if, you know, most, most people turn it, you know, two months, then you put the thing at three months or two and a half months. Right?So then that pool of poor people through now once they get to the third month, it's like, hey, you got this boosting status, you get some other upgrades, and then the next one might be at month eight, \\[...0.5s\\] right?It's like okay, so that's five months later. And once at 8, then it's like, okay, the next one happens in a year. So you can keep bumping out how long it is. Just like video games, the first level is really easy, second level is a little bit harder.When you go from level 99 to level 100, it takes you more time than took you to get the first 20 levels.Same idea. So a good friend of mine actually does this and after a while she found that her customers cared more about the title than any other bonus that she gave. And she told me that they even introduce themselves to her by their title.So if you can't think of something to give them at the very least, you can just call them something special.And so people come to her and be like, hi, I'm Double Diamond, \\[...0.4s\\] or hey, I'm a gold, right, it's like, \\[...0.4s\\] hey, if it's \\[...0.9s\\] status is the cheapest thing that you can give someone, and also many people value more than just about anything else.All right, \\[...0.4s\\] you can make free bonuses discounts, and make discounts free bonuses, \\[...0.4s\\] so hear me out. So free bonus, become a member for$200, and you get this thousand dollar program as a free bonus, steep discount, get the thousand dollar program for$1 if you become a member for 200.So again the free plus discount thing you can make, you can interchange these things when making your continuity offer anchor the bonuses.First, \\[...0.4s\\] sell them the benefits of the amazing bonus, not the continuity offer, the bonus. Then use your high value bonus as an anchor. It may shock them, and that's okay.Remember the anchor up saw same idea. We can still use it as an anchor. Now the higher up we go, \\[...0.7s\\] then the more it's gonna become an acre and less likely for them to buy it. The lower it is, the more people buy.And I'll give you the exact math on that in a second, because when you ask, hey, do you wanna know how you can get this for free? If they do, which they will \\[...0.4s\\] explain, hey, just become a VIP member today and you'll get it \\[...0.4s\\] all as a free gift just for Jordan, or you can just buy it on its own for XXX. Which would you prefer?So someone's doing the math, they're like, shoot, this thing's a grand, or I get the grand thing for free when I sign up for 200 bucks a month.Well, basically at month five, I quote, break even, but I still get all the value of being a member. Well, I'll do that now. If that price was$300 or you get the 300 dollar thing for free when you do the 200 dollar membership, you might be like, \\[...0.6s\\] I'll just do 300 dollar thing.So how big you price, the difference will indicate how many people take the upfront cash versus \\[...0.4s\\] the continuity offer. And so more bonuses get more people to join. That's the TLDR, so after you ask him if they wanna know how to get it for free, you tell them that they can when they join.Then you say on top of that, when you become a member, you'll get amazing thing 1, amazing thing 2, amazing thing 3, and mention the individual dollar values of each \\[...0.4s\\] to anchor that value.And actually it further stacks the value of the 200 dollar thing, and so tacky bonuses this way gets even more people to join the continuity.So here's the math example. I told you that was gonna break down, so we ran this test, and I can only say that this works \\[...0.5s\\] for \\[...0.4s\\] brick and mortar fitness sales in this offer structure that being said.If I were betting man, which I am, I would bet this pretty much transfers across \\[...0.6s\\] domains, especially service businesses pricing for continuity versus offer cash. So for whatever reason, \\[...0.5s\\] people pick one time payments over continuity, even with higher one time payments.And to be fair, I'm kind of this way. So if someone says, hey, do you wanna sign up for membership or do you just wanna sign up for one month? One a month is twice the price, I might be like, I don't feel like dealing with the cancellation, just like, just put me on the one month thing. And so offer a higher one time payment option.This way some customers will make you more money today, while other customers stack recurring revenue for tomorrow. So we change the price depending on our goals. I've tested as a ton, at least for me, and the data in this range looks really clear. So this is basically the take rates, \\[...0.5s\\] um, based on the price.So this is the price. So if you're three times the price, you're gonna have almost 90, you know, 90% of people taking continuity. If you're, you know, 1.3 times the price, they're gonna have 50% of people taking continuity and 50% of people taking the one time offer.So this is the actual data as it broke out. So if you wanna get 50% of people to take continuity, then you make the standalone offer 1.33 times, which in my personal experience feels about right.So the example is, hey, this \\[...0.5s\\] one time program is 400 bucks, which would then equate to 2\\. 66 a month if it was 6 weeks \\[...0.4s\\] or 1\\. 99 a month membership. So I say pay 400 \\[...0.4s\\] for 6 weeks or you can become a member for 1.99 a month \\[...0.4s\\] at that point, at that price point, 50\\. 50 will take the, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, 400 dollar offer \\[...0.4s\\] versus doing 1\\. 99 a month, \\[...0.6s\\] even though this is 1.33 times more expensive. And so for me, I find this the most important number because that tells you the break even price in the market.So people basically value at least in this particular setting when we tested this that people value \\[...0.4s\\] not beyond continuity as a 33% premium that they're willing to pay on the price to not have to deal with cancellations or anything like that.I find that to be very interesting. So if we want 60% to choose continuity, we make it \\[...0.8s\\] 1.66 times more. If we want 70%, we double it. If we want 80% to choose continuity, we 2.3 exit. If we want 90% of people to choose continuity, we 2.66 exit. So basically, once you're at about 3 x the price of what they would have to pay, almost everybody takes the continuity. But if you're like, shoot, I would rather get some of that cash up front because, you know, these, these 600 dollar payments they add up, it's not bad.Well, fine. If you have 70% of people choosing continuity, but 30% take something that's twice as expensive, you're actually getting a decent amount of cash up front.And so you see to play with how much cash do I need so that I can offset my Costio car customers? And then I can stack as much recurring as I want.And this is the actual data that we have, the exact numbers for this matter, less than the principle. The smaller the standalone price compared to the continuity price, the more people buy the standalone.The larger the standalone price, the bonus \\[...0.4s\\] price compared to the continuity price, the more people choose continuity. So \\[...0.4s\\] if you want more cash up front, make bonuses and continuity plus bonuses separate offers. Make the bonus offer only a single payment.That's 33 to 266% more expensive than the first month Continuity plus bonus. The bigger the price difference, the fewer standalone purchases you'll have, but the more money you'll make up front from each of them.And based on the data that I shared, people pay 33% more to avoid continuity. In other words, if you charge 33% more for the one time bonus, half will buy. If you want even more cash, offer bulk prepaid discounts. So both continuity upsells boost 30 day profits by a lot.Alright, now I alluded to it earlier, but I'm saying it again cause it's so freaking important. So you offer by 5 months get one free. Only one out of every eight people have to take the upsell to raise 30 day profits by 50%. That can make or break your money model.So think about that only one out of eight people \\[...0.5s\\] need to take your buy five, get one free \\[...0.4s\\] for you to raise by 50% the cash you make in the first 30 days. \\[...1.3s\\] Make the damn offer. No, the laws of discounting applied. The larger the discount, the more people would take it.So if I say buy five get, \\[...0.5s\\] uh, get one, I could also say buy six, get six. And I bet you I get a hell of a lot more people take it and I might double or triple my upfront cash.So this actually takes continuity and turns it into yet another upfront cash play that you can do to offset acquisition costs and scale your advertising. If you want commitments, you can pair the bonus with the commitment.So here's an example. So only allow customers to get the bonus if they join and commit to three, six or 12 months. So you get more people to commit this way, but fewer people will take it at least compared to giving it to everyone else.So I say this way. So \\[...0.4s\\] the original version that I showed you on that chart was, hey, buy the, you can either buy this thing for 500 bucks, whatever it is, or you can get the 500 dollar thing when you join our membership for 200 dollars a month that would zero commitment.I could say \\[...1.0s\\] you can buy this thing for$500, or if you become a member and you commit for six months, we'll give it to you for free. So then I lock in six months \\[...0.5s\\] as the sale, I get them to, to say yes to an extended term. So it's still more money than here, than what I would get that 500 dollars.So I basically give a 500 dollar thing to them to get them to say that they'll give me twelve hundred dollars a commitment or \\[...0.5s\\] 24 hundred dollars if I make it a year. And so you can also, if you want way more people in continuity, you can just incentivize them to take continuity.So that being said in the beginning, if you're not sure what to do, just offer the bonuses standalone, and then have continuity month to month, just to make this easy for you.So here's some summary points \\[...0.5s\\] with continuity bonuses, you give the customer an awesome thing if they sign up today. Typically the bonus itself has more value than the first continuity payment. If you use continuity as an attraction offer, advertise what you give away, not what you sell.As continuity, advertise the bonus, not the membership. Make your bonus related to your core offer, so you engage the right leads. If I say, \\[...0.4s\\] you know, I'm giving away dog toys, I wanna sell dog stuff. You don't wanna give away t shirts to sell tech services. If possible, make your bonuses stuff you already have in do this way. You don't need to change your business in order to accommodate the bonus. More people start continuity \\[...0.4s\\] if you add more bonuses and take away, uh, more bad stuff.In other words, add more discounts \\[...0.6s\\] to add bonuses, add more good stuff only if they sign up \\[...0.6s\\] to discount. Take away the cost of actual products services or features that you normally sell. Sell the value of the bonus before telling them how they can get it for free.This is super important people mess this one up. You have to really you have to, \\[...0.4s\\] you have to sell it as those standalone offer. It's just like the acre. If you don't seriously sell it, people won't seriously consider it. They have to seriously consider it, and then they will be instead of ice.You say, \\[...0.5s\\] now that you're sold on it, do you wanna know how you can get it for free? Now they're gonna want take the con duty offer bonuses as still an option for more offering cash. So you can sell them on the bonus, and then just say cool.The only way to get that is if you sign up as a member, you can do that totally up to you. Um, but if you wanna have some offer cash, which a lot of people do, especially if you're advertising, this is especially important for small businesses and local.Then \\[...0.4s\\] allow, allow them to buy the sandal an offer, and you just price it based on how much cash you need.If you want half the people to take the sandal offer, price it at 33% above \\[...0.4s\\] and to boost upfront cash even more. You can offer anybody who signs up for continuity to prepay for the next 6 months or the next year if they buy in bulk.You basically do a buy X get y free as you're up sell on the back of continuity, you're like, wait a second. Yes, you can move the offers around in terms of your order. This is where it gets fun, \\[...0.4s\\] and that my friends is how call duty bonuses work. \\[...0.3s\\]  \n\\[...1.8s\\]Alright, so we just covered cannudie bonuses and cannudie discounts. Now we go to a special \\[...0.4s\\] cannudie offer \\[...0.4s\\] that I really like a lot. And it's the other two are hella big amorphous versions.This is a very specific play. It'll be the shortest of the three. But for many of you people who have services or anything that's on continuity, especially if you have onboarding or some sort of getting clients results quickly, this thing is a beast.Alright, so here's how I Learned it. So after a long Korean business, a friend of mine entered \\[...0.4s\\] the consulting space with the intention of creating a lifestyle business.So you said, hey, I just rather make 5 million bucks a year with no employees and then have some big company. Um, and he said, you know I don't really lose anyone, so I don't really need to market. I was like that's really interesting, a weird thing to say.I was like so I assume like, alright, so you just collect payments up front whenever somebody says, oh, I don't have any turn. I usually just assume, well, you have no turn if you only have pre payments. He said, no, I've got mostly payment plans. I was like, huh, \\[...0.7s\\] how you do that?He said, well, once you hear it, you're gonna kick yourself for not doing this all along. I was like, alright, so what do you do? He said, I just say that you can pay$25,000 to start and then go month to month after that for$4,000 a month, or \\[...0.4s\\] you can go to$4,000 a month if you commit to the year.So just about everyone takes the year. Then I just have them initial on their contract that they understand if they exit early, they have to cover a 25,000 dollar onboarding fee.So if someone calls to quit, I just say, oh, yeah, no worries, just why over the onboarding fee, I'll get you canceled right away. And that usually keeps people in it. It also gets people the, through the emotional UPS and downs of business. And I was like, that's pretty sweet.So if you look at this visual here, if you had a \\[...0.4s\\] 1000, you know a thousand dollar month continuity plan, right, you can say cool, this is \\[...0.4s\\] 5,000 down, then thousand bucks month a month, or \\[...0.6s\\] I will waive the 5,000 dollar fee \\[...0.4s\\] and it will be free with a 12 month commitment at 1,000 dollars a month, and you pay that if you wanna cancel early. So this is fundamentally a neat cancellation term.Fundamentally, it's what it is, but because we \\[...0.4s\\] pair it as a price on the front end, it becomes a very strong sales thing too. So with the other version, we use the 3 months free or whatever to get someone in, and then we say cool, you have to pay the difference \\[...0.4s\\] if you cancel early.Here, we sell them on the vacation, and we say we have this massive onboarding fee, but I'll weave it if you sign up for a commitment, \\[...0.4s\\] then that also hangs as a knife. If they don't wanna pay today, they're not gonna pay it 6 months either.And so the same reason they signed up is the same reason they'll keep paying. Here's our description, so the way fee offers work like this.First, you ask customers to pay start a fee as a part of doing a month, month program.Typically you wanna do that to three to five times a monthly rate. Alright, so if it was a thousand dollar thing, you'd wanna be a 5,000 dollar, uh, front fee for, you know the example is$4,000 month and 25,000 dollar sign fee, that's the idea.Alright, then you offer discount the entire fee if they commit to the longer term, and the commitment period should be minimum of 6 month, ideally 12+.If it's less than that, it doesn't really make any sense. So if they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee, cush words can choose to pay the big fee and keep the option acquitted anytime, or then commit to 12 months and get the fee waived, and many will commit to avoid the big fee.There's also a clear point after 4, five, six months where if they paid the fee, it's the same as staying in which case it basically gets them through that initial turn point. And then after that, there's no financial reason to leave. They'll back half the contract.So we take the greater risk if they pay month to month, but they take a greater risk if they commit.And so if a customer chooses month to month, we lower our risk with the startup fee, but we lower their risk year to year by waving those fees. And if they commit and they wanna quit early, then okay, they pay the fee as though they had paid month to month from the beginning.Very simple bottom line is that customers will stay longer if leaving cost more than stag, and to make this equitable, if they stay the full term, they can cancel if they choose with no fee. That's what makes it fair to both parties.So if you need to feel better about yourself for charging these things, whether real or made up, \\[...0.4s\\] you should get that looked at.But if you need a reason why, well, here's a perfectly reasonable, also made up reason \\[...0.4s\\] for you. You can say this whenever we onboard a new customer, it always takes more resources than an existing customer who's been with us for multiple months.So in order to give you the best experience, we charge a one time onboarding fee, set up activation engagement, enrollment, whatever made up thing you wanna say to give you the experience, \\[...0.4s\\] bad experience, so you'll never have to bid again, and it's for your own benefits, you get the most out of your experience.Now we know that if you learn how to use our services the right way, you'll be 23.7 x times more successful. So you can say initiation onboarding, enrollment, start up, set up, processing activation, build commencement.You can just use whatever word you want, then put the word fee afterwards, and that's what it can be. So that is our description. Let me give you some examples. So we'll use all combinations, but we'll assume$5,000 onboarding fee in a thousand dollar month for all of them.Okay, so \\[...0.4s\\] we fee with commitment is my personal favorites, clean and simple commitments, 12 months, monthly rates, thousand dollars a month fees$5,000 \\[...0.4s\\] if they pay month a month option A, pay one time 5 grand plus$1,000 for the first month, then pay thousand dollars a month thereafter, kids, whenever you want.Option B, waive the five thousand dollars if you commit to 12, pay thousand dollars per month, only pay the five thousand dollar fee if you break your commitment early boom.Very simple, very straightforward. There's a visual if you want, you can do a different version of this where you keep \\[...0.5s\\] the month to month rate higher, so if they cancel the discounted commitment, you build the difference.Alright, so let's say, uh, they \\[...0.4s\\] basically the longer they stay, the bigger the cancellation rate.So if they've accrued, you know, uh$177 of savings or$67 of savings every single month on their commitment, the day they wanna, they wanna break the contract, they pay the difference in savings up to that point.Let's do some important points. So four variables for this method, you've got the commitment length, you've got the commitment rate, you've got the month to month rate, and you've got the fee that they're gonna wave or not.There are more versions of this beyond the two that I shared. You can figure them out on your own. Now I had an earlier version of this that had like nine different versions \\[...0.4s\\] and my editor was like, you're honestly just gonna confuse people, so don't do that.So \\[...0.4s\\] fundamentally though, you can mix and match these however you want. You can have a like the rate difference between the people who commit can be less, you can have the length be available, the rate that you charge month, the month is different, the fee that you wave. So all of those things kind of go into this deal structure.The recommendation that I have is a model that works, which is take the price, multiply by 5, make that the fee, wave it. And that holds that basically hangs over the head all time.And if you want, again, the ethical reason for this is that many businesses and many \\[...0.5s\\] services have emotional UPS and downs their volatility for customers.And so \\[...0.4s\\] having something kind of like guardrails to keep someone on point during the rough months \\[...0.4s\\] can help them overall see success. And I believe that, so that's not just, not that's not just wordsmithing that's true. Um.And this \\[...0.7s\\] vehicle or pricing structure, money model allows you to build incentives around that. All right, so \\[...0.6s\\] fees get them to start. People get valued of committee immediately because they avoid a fee. People want to avoid fees, so more people sign up to continuity, mission accomplished, Hooray.That's how this works. Fees also get them to stick, which is lovely. So people will stick for the same reason they started by sticking to avoid the fee.So people quit for millions of reasons, but by incurrenting an additional cost, a larger fee in order to cancel, their original reason for quitting immediately shrinks compared to the value of hitting the fee in English.If the cost to quit exceeds the cost to stay, they will probably stay presenting the fee.Justify the fee by explaining the cost of taking on new customers for longer term programs. Basically, if they want short term flexibility, they pay their own setup costs. If they commit to staying long term, we'll pay their setup costs for them.Right. If someone asks for additional reason, just say it costs us money to get you started. If you only wanna test us out, you cover those cost. If you commit to longer, I'll cover them.Now if more than 5% of people wanna cancel early, look into that pricing incentivizes sticking, but it can't and shouldn't overcome a terrible product.You want to nudge them, not handcuff people into paying for something they hate, cause then they'll just hate you. Now if you want \\[...0.6s\\] more offering cash, have a smaller fee. A smaller fee encourages more people to go month to month.This is the same \\[...0.6s\\] difference we had with the earlier version with the continuity bonus offer. Same idea except this is just a fee rather than a program. But some people will pay and I'll tell you what my guess would be to get 50, 50 to sign up, which should be a 33% increase.A smaller fee will get more people to go month to month. A larger fee will encourage more people to make, but if you need more cash up front, then you can make the fee one and a/2 to three times the monthly rate. And that will get more people to choose that more flexible option. And when you do this, more people will take it. Great, and you get more cash up front.So \\[...0.4s\\] you can drop the fee after the customer fulfills the commitment, right? So if someone stays the entirety of the commitment and I'm repeating this cause some people forget about this, and then once they cancel, then they have honored their commitment and then you need to honor the fact that they don't need to pay that fee anymore. That is what makes it equitable. That's what makes it fair.Okay, so I prefer this offer for commitments over one year and longer. Alright, so the longer the commitment, the better this works. This works especially well with services that take a long time to work, so think about SEO investing, weight loss, these are all things that take a long time for someone to really get closer to their goals. It keeps people committed when they get emotional cancellation fees for a cost.So this is, like, a 2:01 version of this. Um, but if you wanna keep customers extra motivated, you can donate the money that they would be paying \\[...0.4s\\] for a cause that they are against. So you just say hey, what cause do you absolutely hate? Great, if you cancel early, I will be donating your entire set of fee to them. So this gives them two reasons to stay.First, because they don't wanna show out the cash, second, because they don't wanna caught. They don't wanna give it to a, cause they hate summary.So we fee offers present a month, a month option with a fee or a we fee. If they commit, I typically make it 3 to 5 times by monthly rate at minimum. The commitment less should be a year.The larger fee, the more buyers will opt for commitment. The smaller fee, the more people will do the month to month option, which will give you more cash up front. If the customer meets the commitment, the fee officially goes away, boom. That is the way fee offer. \\[...0.1s\\]"

And if you're like, man, that was amazing, \\[...0.6s\\] yes, I love those. And \\[...0.5s\\] the problem is \\[...0.4s\\] what happens when someone says no, enter down sell offers, \\[...0.4s\\] so down so offers the third prong of our four prong money model, it's what you do when someone says no.So here's the description \\[...0.5s\\] in the last section, he's up to offers to get people to buy more stuff. If we did a good job, we've turned a profit.Two \\[...0.4s\\] down sales begin after a customer says no. We find a solution to meet the customer's budget, so we down sell in two ways. We change how they pay or what they get. So how they pay, how much they pay versus how much they pay over time, so now versus later, and then what they get, which means the quality, the quantity or something different.So here's what not to do, so these are the rules of not downselling, so this is a real story from a friend. So I was buying a car and the salesman tried to upsell car insurance, the cost, the insurance when he first started was$5,000.I said no, \\[...0.4s\\] but then he lowered the price. I said no again. He kept lowering the price until the same insurance he first offered was \\[...0.8s\\] for$5,000, was now$400.I still said no at first, I said no because it was way too much money, but by the end, I said no because I didn't trust the guy, the entire experience felt dirty. Then I wondered, was he ripping me off in the car too?Now I didn't wanna buy the car from him either. How to not downsell \\[...0.7s\\] people, lower the price to close a sale, but even if you close this one sale, the customer will question every other price you offer them from that point going forward. And whoever they tell that's the bad part, not just them, everyone else too. So you trade trust for a buck, \\[...0.3s\\] not worth it.Here's the note, you can offer something different for less, you just can't offer the same thing for less. If he had offered different insurance for less rather than the same insurance for less, you probably would have been fine and kept your trust in close sale.So the key point was that he offered the same thing that was once 5K for$400. That's the problem because now it basically means that your price has no meaning, and you're making it all up, which, of course, we do make it all up, but we never admit that.So let's begin \\[...1.0s\\] rule of downside, remember that they said no to this offer. Not all offers see it for what it is an opportunity to find out what they really want, and then profit from it.Downsells are trades. When downselling, you work with the customer, refine a combination of giving and getting until you get a match.So if you're gonna give something, you should get something back personalized, don't pressure. So figure out what they like and what they don't like, then offer more of what they like and less or what they don't with a price to match it.If someone refuses my large soda upsell, I can offer them alternatives. I could ask if they want a small or juice or coffee.Am I being offensive by asking? No, it's offensive not to offer to help offering the same thing in new ways. You limit downsells to what you've got, so think of downsell as more like 100 ways to offer the stuff you already have, not 100 different offers. Don't drop your price just to get someone to buy.Alright, I'm gonna reinforce those in, cause this is the one that everyone just keeps messing up.First off, dropping your price is not downselling, it's discounting. So if someone wants what you have and just doesn't wanna pay the price, well, that's tough cookies. On the other hand, you can offer them to pay less now, and more money over time, which is a payment plan.So let's go through the lineup, we're gonna go through payment plan down sales, how they pay, draw with penalty, which is also how they pay, but just a very in depth tactical thing that \\[...0.5s\\] I think people do trials wrong.And I'll explain how I like to do them, uh, feature down sales, which is changing what they get for the price.These down sales boost 30 day profits even further. They do it by making even more sales when customers would have said no. And you can use a downsell offer at any point in a money model. You can use it up front, you can use it after someone takes an upsell, says no doing upsell, you can use it on the back end.Any of those things, and that \\[...0.6s\\] begins our downso offers. Let's start with payment plan down cells, \\[...1.5s\\] so we just covered down so offers, now let's rock and roll into payment plan doubt cells, the main 5 is always, \\[...0.6s\\] and let us begin.So here's how I Learned it. \\[...1.7s\\] One month in the business, I got one month's rent left, and I'd only made a few sales at first week.So halfway through the month, a prospect comes in and I really needed the cash, and so she said no to buying. And so normally I just would have given up, but I really needed the cash. And so I was like, alright, well, can you put half down? And she said, no. And I was like, okay, can you put a third down? Will do three payments. And she's like, no. I was like, well, what can you do? She's like, well, I can't do anything today. She's like, but I get paid on the first, I can put the whole thing down then. And rent was doing the fifth. And so I was like, okay, so I put zero dollars down today.And then I put her whole payment on the first, and \\[...1.0s\\] it went through and I was able to pay rent and always well in the world. Hooray.So that was my first real experience with learning how payment plan down sales worked. I got a little more sophisticated over time, which is what I'll share with you. So here's how they work overall.So payment plans work for any price tag. That's one of the nice benefits that they are a gamble. They make money when customers complete payments. They lose money when people cancel before you profit or when people who would have paid in full take payment plans instead and then cancel early.So note, this is not selling a cheaper thing. This is selling the same thing with different payment terms.And so people reject offers when they cost too much today, not necessarily when they cost too much overall, this is a massive miscommunication and misunderstanding for salespeople and business owners.People saying no doesn't necessarily mean that you're missed priced. It just means that you might have to change the terms of payment. Alright, it's usually about what they have to pay right now, not what they have to pay in general. And so people mistakenly think that they need cheaper stuff.And this is not the best course of action in my opinion, payment plans get the most buyers to pay the highest price by to get them to pay less now in the moment, but pay full price or higher over time.So here are the 7 steps of a payment plan downso we reward for paying in full rather than punish for paying overtime.This is a big thing that I don't see taught very much, and so I'm gonna explain this one in depth cause really important. Uh, next, we're gonna offer financing options half now, half later.Check to see if they want the thing, offer to split in the 3 payments or evenly spread the payments, offer free trial. So let's give some deep down examples. So step 1, reward for paying in full rather than punish for paying overtime.So if I take on the risk of a payload, because if you're a business owner, and they don't pay you everything, and you start delivering stuff, then you take on risk, right, so then what I do is I increase the price.Now normally businesses do this by charging interest, but everybody hates \\[...0.6s\\] getting charged interest. And so instead, what I do is I anchor my first price I present is the fully baked payment plan price.And then when I say, \\[...0.6s\\] got it, would you like to save some money? They say yes, and I'm like, you can prepay and save this much money, so now them prepaying is a savings rather than getting penalized.So think about, like, this, let's say it's 10 k and 12 k, 10 k is the paid in full price, 12 k is the payment plan price \\[...0.4s\\] instead of, instead of pitching people, cause remember anchors still work instead of pitching people 10, and then they say they know they can't afford it, and then say okay, fine, pay me 12 because you can't afford, it \\[...0.5s\\] feels tough, so instead pitch 12.I know you're afraid of doing it. Don't be \\[...0.4s\\] the difference in interest is usually never enough to change a purchasing decision.So, like, if you had 10 and 20, then, yeah, but most interest whatever you usually, you know, add on top might be 10, 20%, and so that's not usually enough to get into different buying tier.So you present here \\[...0.5s\\] and if someone says yes, and by the way, if everyone keeps saying yes at that and then you don't even have to mention the prepay, then it also allows you to incrementally step up and get kind of like a soft indication in the marketplace of whether or not you can sustain a higher price point.So I actually like to use payment plans as a great test for where I'm anchoring and I can keep nudging up my price before I start seeing people freak out. So it's kind of like a testing price.So I would present 12, they say, I'm not sure if I can do it or maybe they can do it and they great wanna save some money now. They prepay 10 and they're stoked. If they can't do 12, then it's like, fine, oh, you don't have to do it all up front, but now I don't have to increase the price.They said they couldn't do 12, and then I said cool, you wanna spread it over time, and now it seems like I'm adding no interest to the original price. See how different that feels like. Oh, you can't do 12\\. We can break in payments for you, but, oh, you can't do 10, then pay me 12\\. It's, like, \\[...0.7s\\] tough, \\[...0.4s\\] right, and this gets around all of that, so No.2 third party financing credit card and layaway option.So third party financing means another company pays me now or pays you now as a business owner. And the customer has a payment plan with them, the other party.So car dealers do this all the time. The dealer gets money from the financing company today, and the customer pays the financing company tomorrow. Most times, by the way, adding third party financing in \\[...0.5s\\] increases revenue by 35% \\[...0.6s\\] on average. Note.It does take work to get third party financing set up, but it is typically worth the effort. Credit cards, now you're like, how is this, \\[...0.4s\\] how is this third party financing? I Learned this from Master Salesman, so I will just teach it to you as I was taught.To me, \\[...1.1s\\] this is insane clothes that this works, and it does work, and it still blows my mind that it works. Just ask, would you rather that I decide your payment terms or that you decide? Everyone then says, well, I would prefer to decide.And when they do, you just say awesome, just use your credit card that way, you can \\[...0.7s\\] pick whatever payment plan you want that works for you. If they say, well, shoot, what's the alternative?That then you say I have an inhouse plan which is me picking the date to when you got to pay. And that's usually gonna be a much shorter time frame than what a credit card would allow you to pay it on.And so as crazy as this is, it's wild to me that this reframe actually works, \\[...0.4s\\] but it does, so \\[...0.4s\\] especially if you sell to consumers like that reframe works, no idea why, I only state what I know that it works.All right, \\[...0.5s\\] the next one is layaway. This is actually a personal favorite of mine. Layaway means paying off the product before getting it. This is actually how they used to do in the olden days when there was no credit and banks were all sketchy. People would do layaway.They go to the store, they say, hey, I wanna buy that thing. And the guy would say, great, drop off money every Monday for the next four Mondays and then I'll give it to you. And it was a very simple way. Now the thing is that the customer takes on the risk, not the business.But in my opinion, I think there's a lot of really weird little psychological things with it because \\[...0.4s\\] if you make payments, \\[...0.5s\\] it's like, it's like building up anticipation for a vacation. It's like the whole time like, man, I can't wait to get this thing, I can't wait to get this thing.On the flip side, when you get the whole thing and then you make payments, you already got the value and now every time you pay, you like hate them a little bit more, right? I mean, ideally that's not the case, but I'm just, I'm just explaining my experience as a consumer.Some businesses can't do this. They can't, they can't do a layaway. But if you do have the opportunity or the option where it's where you can delay starting for a little bit, whether it's a service or it's a product, having them start paying is a great way to do this. And the nice thing with layways it's as flexible as you want. And I'll tell you the story of how I Learned this.So I had \\[...0.6s\\] Allen, which was our software company. I mean, we still in 25% of it, but \\[...0.9s\\] when we started the business, I Learned that in person on boardings LED to higher stick rates and happier customers and you want to get more customer feedback etc. And so \\[...0.4s\\] I would do a single company full day onboarding or half day onboarding.And I was on the phone selling that onboarding, now the onboardings for context, these, this was an enterprise level sale. So it was like,$20,000 to just be able to white label the stuff, um, and then use the, the whole product, cause it added a whole another revenue stream to agencies.And so I was on the phone, this is must have been the first week or two. And I was on with these \\[...0.4s\\] young agency owners, \\[...1.2s\\] and they said, \\[...0.4s\\] um okay, 20 got, do you guys do payment plans? And I was like, yeah, sure. Um, I said you can break it up however you want, \\[...0.5s\\] and they were like, awesome, so we'll just do 800 bucks every other week.So that's what they said, \\[...0.4s\\] and they're like, so with that being said, we get to come out, you know uh you know, next week. And I was like, oh no, \\[...0.4s\\] no, you can't come out.I was like, you can split it as many times as you want, but you gotta pay it off in the moment. You paid off, you can fly out. And they, they just said, oh, \\[...1.1s\\] alright, we'll put half down now and half in a month, and then we'll come out then.And so \\[...0.4s\\] they wanted to delay my payment for like six months or more than that, whatever the math is on that. And then as soon as I said, oh no, you don't get the thing until you pay. They were able to do it in, in a month.And so the nice thing with layways that actually aligns your incentives with the customers. They want to pay it off as fast as possible, so they can get the thing. When it's the other way, when you're giving the value, they're incentivized to make it last as long as possible.This is why I like layaway for the variety reasons. You can close anyone, you can make the payment terms as flexes if you want. You take, don't take on risk. They have this kind of like working for it, earning it \\[...0.5s\\] type feel. And for all those reasons, I really like layaway.Now if they say no to all of those offers, I move to step 3\\. So guys, these are in sequence, so first we do the prepayment thing, they say no. Then we offer financing, they say no. We say, great, can you do half now and half later? So then I say, when's the next time you get paid?If I'm doing a consumer sale, if I'm doing a b to B sale, I'd be like, when's your next inflow of cash or do you have some sort of, you know revenue thing?Do you have any big contrast hitting whatever? After that, I say wanna just put half down a day and then the rest down we get paid. If they can't do that, then I say, okay, well, what's the most you can put down today?And I like that question cause it just cuts the core, but what's the most you can put down today? When they offered him out, you say, great, we'll put that down today. We'll put the rest when you get paid. Fair enough. So instead of doing half down, I might put a quarter down 75% when they get paid.But all I'm trying to do is compress forward cash. Remember, money models, what we're trying to do with customer finance acquisition is get as much as we can in the first 30 days. And this payment plan downside process is structured to do that.So I like scheduling payments off of paycheck since that's when most people get paid every two weeks. So this boosts 30 day profits more than monthly payments. So it's like half now, half two weeks, and then half, then, you know a third in the next two weeks. So all I get three payments 30 days, which is great.And if they can't do those, I pause to make sure they actually want it. So sometimes people just keep saying no, and I'm like, hey, pulse check, temperature check. We still good, you still wanna do this. And so this is how I do it. No payment plans gonna satisfy a customer who doesn't want the thing.So make sure the person actually wants the thing before putting more effort into selling it. So I might say something like, got it, somebody's tight right now.Real quick, just wanna make sure on a scale from one to 10, how bad you wanna do this \\[...0.5s\\] now. If they say 8 or above, then I keep offering payment plans, say awesome, don't worry, we're gonna figure out something's gonna work for you. If they say 7 or below, I say why not a ten?And then say something like, you're right. I think we may have something that could be a better fit for you. And then I pivot the sale, and so then you sell something different, which this is actually an outpoint or exit ramp that goes into feature down sales, which is \\[...0.5s\\] two, two videos from now.So step five, we offer a split into three payments, so remember this point they said 8 to 10 right on the scale, I downsaw from half down to a third down, so I offer a 3 payment option, so 1/3 now, 1/3 on the next two paychecks, or 1/3 now, and then 1/3 the next two months. If they still can't do it, then I offer to evenly spread payments.So if they still can't manage it, I evenly spread the payments or the rest of their service. So even if someone signs up for 6 months of service, it doesn't mean you need to have them pay you over 6 months. You can have them pay you in three months.For six months of service, you wanna still frontload as much as you can. You're the one who had to pay the cost of one on boarding customer, but also of acquiring the customer. So for instance for Jim Lodge, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, it was 16 weeks long.So for us in that business, I charge them each week 16 times in total. So that was me spreading it all the way out. If that still creates a problem, I moved to step 7\\. Now to be clear, I dealt with very, very broke customers. Most humans don't make any money. And so I had I basically this was so, so commonly the payment plan that ended up basically just having prepayment financing evenly spread because I just kept getting so many knows all the way out.You simplify it and at the end of this, I'll walk you through this, but fundamentally this is how you map kind of the network of what your down your down cell process will be. And then over time you tighten it until it's like these are the highest likelihood stop points that my Avatar tends to say yes to.So step 7 is you offer free trial. Now I offer free trials in a very special way. So I dedicate the whole next video just to doing this, but normally the sale ends here. I mean you can't really get much lower than free trial, \\[...0.4s\\] right? So here are some important points about payment points.What I walk you through is a seven step downstar process. It's how I like to map these now. There's a different methodology of downselling that's simpler to understand and less to explain.It's called seesaw downselling. I like it a lot as well. It's \\[...0.5s\\] simpler to explain. You can pick whichever one you want, and I don't like giving people options, cause people like being told what to do. But I think if you're watching this, and I believe in you, and I think that you can make the best decision.So \\[...0.8s\\] instead of just asking for the full amount, you say, would you rather have giant monthly payments or tiny ones? They'll say tiny, then you say, well, it normally costs XXX, and if you prepaid today, then you get a huge discount and zero monthly payments that work.This frames the payment plan as a negative and highlights the benefits of prepaid. If they say they can't afford it, say \\[...0.5s\\] the more they put down now, the lower their monthly payments, and so basically frames all of the payments as we wanna make those payments as low as possible.So put more put more down a day. So if you can't afford it up front totally get it. We'll just adjust the down payment so you get a monthly rate you like. The thing is, is that most people want low monthly payments, and so in order to get a monthly rate, they like they have to put more up front.So the see saw downsaw, I called this because you're just saying, okay, well, the more you put down or the less you put down, the more you have to pay over time. The less you put, the more the more you put down the less you have to pay over time. And so this incentivizes bigger down payments, get monthly payments lower.If they still say no, you ask if they still want the product just like before. If they do, you pull your chair to their side of the table and walk them through the options. That's how this works.That's the see saw down. So it's an alternative path that felt I felt obligated to share with you guys. The thing is, is I like I think with larger sales teams just having very clear step downs, sometimes seesaw downselling can get really weird payment plans. And so \\[...0.4s\\] this is for bigger companies.If you have, like, a finance department, they might hate seesaw downseling, because, but if you're owner operated, then you can you can kind of work out whatever payment plans work. And it is a more flexible way to make payment plans option \\[...0.4s\\] payment plans happen.The seven step one is more, like, it's ironclad, this is our first stop, this, our second stop, this, our third stop, and then that way your, your finance team can be like, these are the plans, they're in the CRM, we track them accordingly, whatever, and so it depends on the size of the business seesaws, \\[...0.5s\\] smaller business, more flexible stuff, the step downs \\[...0.6s\\] has more skill to it in my opinion.All right, so payment plans have built in upsells, so this is one of those really key sexy things that a lot of people miss out on, and we've made a lot of money from it. So make periodic offers for the original paid full discount during their payment plan.So we give a pre payment discount, what you can do is also extend the timeline that they can prepay and still get the discount.So if you're in any kind of beta be business, especially thing marketing or sales driven, if you are helping them make more money in the business, which the vast majority of beta be businesses do, then you can say, hey, no worries, you might not trust us fully today.Let's get a third down, we'll get going, and then I'll still give you this prepayment discount for the next 30 days. I'll honor it. So then at the 2 weeks and 3 weeks point, you can say, hey, do you wanna go ahead and do that? Hey, we're about a week before the, the term expires.Do you wanna go ahead and take care of the rest of the balance and still get the discount if you've done a decent job, a lot of people like, yeah, I'll take the savings cause now they know you.And so we get a ton of people who take that pre payment if you just extend the window and you say it on the sale you say it on the sale after they don't take obviously the first pre payment, and you do that after you've already closed the card. You're kind of telling them what the next steps are.Okay, fewer decline payments. So a line payment schedule with paycheck dates that should seem straightforward when they get paid is when you should Bill. That way you have fewer declines, fewer insufficient funds. Um, how to make sure payment plans make you money.So after implementing payment plans, if you hadn't done these before, your clothes rate should increase. Duh, but if the number of paid fools goes down, you have a problem. It means you're actually getting people who used to pay you in full and now taking payment points. So \\[...0.4s\\] those are the big points.All right, \\[...0.6s\\] summary, payment plans sells spread the cost of a product by charging some of it up front and putting the rest into scheduled payments.Payment plans get more buyers like discounts do, but can also boost profits because they agree to paying full price over time, it's, kind of, the best of both worlds. Payment plans only grow your business if, if they get you more customers, and those customers actually pay. See, saw downselling gradually shows from paid in full to equal payments.It's a little bit more custom, and it's a little more, more headache on the back end.If you have a small business, you can probably handle it. If you're bigger business, it can be, kind of, a pain \\[...0.5s\\] payment plan up sales, they get the original discounted price if they pay the balance today or up to X period of time before that discount expires. Align the payment schedules with paycheck schedules, and you will get fewer decline payments.These are the 7 steps of the down sale process. Full price, then offer a discount if they paid full.Step 2: third party financing, credit card financing, and lay away options. Step 3: split the payment in two and schedule on their paycheck dates. Step 4: ask if they still want the product. This is the off ramp to a feature downsell. If it's 8 or above, you're good to go.If it's below that, I would I would suggest switching the features around. Step 5, split the payments into three. Schedule their paycheck dates or monthly. Step 6, schedule equal payments over the entire duration of time they're working for you.Step 7: offer free trial in exchange for putting a guard down, which I will cover in depth in the next video.Two quick pro tips. No. 1, if you're like, what do I pay sales people on a payment plant? I have always competed off cash collected today. Uh, main reason for that is that requires more salesmanship, and that aligns the interest of the salesman with the interest of the business, which is getting paid today.And if someone goes in a payment plan, and then you do a great job, they continue to pay.That's more the success of the on boarding team, the delivery team, which means that you should be able to save any access commissions on a payment plan for people on the back end. If they're the ones making sure they're getting paid. So No.1, \\[...0.6s\\] number two, \\[...0.6s\\] if you have a recurring revenue business, people like, well, how do you do payment plans in a recurring revenue business?You simply state the annual contract as the price. So let's say it's$3,000 a month for whatever your service is. You say, hey, it's$36,000, and if you prepay for your service, you get it for 30, \\[...0.5s\\] right? If not, no sweat, and then you go into whatever your monthly payments at$3,000 a month.If with a recurring service, you might only have two step downs instead of seven because you might not have all these kind of like evenly spice things that's more for kind of upfronts or defined end periods things. And with that being said, \\[...0.5s\\] now we go on to \\[...0.9s\\] free trials.\\[...1.8s\\]Alright, so we just completed payment pen downsals, and if you get to the end of the 7 steps, and someone's like, I still don't wanna pay you, or I still don't have the money.Either way, you can offer a free trial, and I've run a lot of free trials in my life, and I think there's a wrong way to do them and a better way to do them. And I will explain the better way, so \\[...0.9s\\] save 5 as always. Let's break down how I Learned this puppy.So, um, we were scaling gym launch, \\[...0.4s\\] and we needed an HR platform, and Layla was looking at all these different platforms, and she ended up \\[...0.4s\\] going with this one. And I was like, well, what made you, you know, pick that platform versus the other?She was like, honestly, they were all more or less the same, but these guys said they charged me 500 bucks, and if I attended the two \\[...0.7s\\] are three training sessions, they would rebate me to$500, but if I didn't attend the onboarding and training sessions, they would keep it.And so of course I attended the sessions and now I know how to use their software and I don't feel like learning anyone else's. And so they actually got a customer and we stayed with that platform for years because of a really interesting way of basically doing a free trial.Now \\[...0.6s\\] theirs was, they charged and then did a rebate. But I saw the structure and was like, oh, this is really interesting. And so I was like, what if we did trials like this? And so that's who we started doing. And so I called a trial with penalty. That sounds ugly.That's how I called internally. Wouldn't say that to somebody, but it's a trial with penalty. So basically a customer can try your product to service for free so long as they meet your terms.For comparison, the win your money back offer, the attraction offer gives customers the chance to get their money back if they meet the terms. In a trial with penalty offer, customers only pay if they don't meet the terms.So the win your money back and the free trial with penalty are virtually the same offer. We're just changing when they pay and how they pay, so they'll mirror the actions and results that you used in win your money back.But this time we use avoiding fees rather than winning your money back as the incentive for adherents. So they avoid penalties rather than \\[...1.0s\\] get or losing their money that they paid originally.Alright, so with a trial with penalty, this isn't, here's my thing. See, if you like it, it's, here's my thing. You get it for free so long as you do this stuff, which makes you perfect fit for my mixed offer. And if you don't, then you have to pay for it.So it's, kind of, like a win win for you because if they don't do it, then they pay, and if they do do it, then they're gonna be really likely to buy the next thing. Now I'm gonna give you some, like, wait, so if they don't do it, then they pay, and they didn't wanna pay originally.I'll cover how to get around that weirdness. Let's say you normally close three out of 10 people on your attraction offer, and now you downsell another four \\[...0.4s\\] on a trial with penalty.Then after the trial finishes, you upsell three of them, \\[...0.4s\\] so you go from three sales to six sales, which doubles your customers. I use this as a downsub, but it could also be used as a front ed. So I don't prefer to advertise this.I prefer to present this after someone already said no to giving me money. Some people advertise this is how they get customers, it's up to you, obviously, that HR company advertised it how they get customers.So if you really wanna help people convincing them to put some skin in the game is a great way to do it.It's one of my sales rules that everyone buys something who's qualified, and so I love that as a consequence, like, everyone should buy, like if they're qualified and we have the thing every person should buy.The terms may change what everyone should buy, so here's the difference between trials and penalties and rebates.A trial is they, you just get a card and then build them later. A penalty slash incentive is you get a card end Bill later, and also if they don't complete their activation activities, so the fees are associated with non consumption and not showing up to other sales consultations.Remember the 4 things we had in the win your money back, is you wanna have them advertise your business, you wanna have them show for sales consults, you wanna do things that, um, that get them results, \\[...0.8s\\] and there's another one, a camera to us, but there's four, and \\[...0.6s\\] there's the main ones, alright, so you want to associate them doing the things to get them results, because if they get results in the probably wanna buy.Alright, so \\[...0.5s\\] they're not here for a trial, they're here to solve a problem, so solve it, because trials don't do anything, \\[...0.4s\\] them taking actions, that's what's gonna solve their problem.If someone has a problem with that, it's an easy thing to get around. Think about the logic. If someone says, I'm not willing to commit to that, you're like, well, do you want the outcome? They're gonna say yes, it's like, well, you have to do this stuff to get the outcome, so if you don't, if you don't plan on doing this stuff, then you're never going to get the outcome. This is just the easiest way that I can give you all this service for free. If you really do wanna do this, I do wanna do this.Great, then you're not gonna pay anything, cause you're gonna follow through, and this just gives you added incentive to do it. And if this doesn't work for you, then certainly nothing else will.So let's walk through some examples, so I'll do a beta CE version, so business consumer, then I'll do a beta B so let's see you do a business consumer offer 28 day kick that habit blooper, whatever, right, so you get the trial for free and avoid the penalty fee.You must or to get the trial for free and avoid the penalty fee, you must attend all your consulting calls, push your progress in the group once a week, journal daily in our app, and attend feedback sessions and transformation senses aka, the upsell opportunities business to business offer 5 day, get your first 5 clients challenge, \\[...0.4s\\] right, to get the draw for free and avoid the penalty fee, you must send 100 oppound messages per day, report stats on the opp on messages, attend the daily training, post in the group daily.Once you've done the homework, attend your graduation call, which is the UPS opportunity. And so these look really similar to what the when your money back ones were, because they're the same thing.Now let's see you in a therapy business, so offer a free 20 a day breakthrough therapy free trial prospenity.You're gonna need \\[...0.4s\\] to do the homework before each session and show up. If you don't do the homework, you're not going to get the results you want. And if you don't show up, obviously, you're not gonna get better. This will give you an added incentive to get better faster.So we charge a 50 dollar non compliance fee for not doing the homework or not doing the session. If you don't do the homework, then we can't help you in the session.Fair enough, \\[...0.4s\\] you should explain it how it works. Now \\[...0.4s\\] in this 28 day thing, \\[...0.4s\\] you can have all the fees add up to the exact same amount of money that you would have charged in a win your money back.So if they have call it 10 things they have to do \\[...0.4s\\] over X period of time, and it's a 500 dollar thing. Then you charge 50 dollars per thing.Now if some things are more important than others, let's say sales consultations, then you can make those ones hundred dollars or 150 dollars, and the other things 25\\. You wanna weight the prices based on the importance for you as a business and for them getting results. So here's my actual step down process of how I sell free trials.So No. 1 is you offer the trial last. If someone makes it clear that they don't want your first offer, then down sell the trial penalty. So here's how it might sound, \\[...0.6s\\] hmm, well, that sure is a pickle. Uh, I'll tell you what, how about we just get you started for free? Would you be okay with that? Great, \\[...0.4s\\] we can help you out, and if you like it, you can stay. Just let me get your ID, we get the process started.Fair enough, by the way, here's a little savage pro tip. If you're in person or you're seeing the person via zoom, when you ask someone for their ID, they have to take their wallet out.When they take their wallet out, they can't say they forgot their wallet. And so now you get the card, they can hold it up to the camera, or they can give it to you in person, and then you take that. And what I like to do is I like to fill out the contract for them for a number of reasons.One is when they fill out the contract, you kind of stare there like a weirdo, which is not fun. So instead, you fill out the contract, and then you can make jokes about whatever's going on. You like, oh, man, I should show you my picture. It's brutal.Oh, you're from Idaho originally. That's interesting. Oh, you know what? My cousin lives out there. Blah blah, blah, right, you're going through and you're filling this out, and you also make sure that everything's filled out properly and they didn't mess up the form, whatever.So then the way I would do it is I had the card between my fingers, my index fingers, and I would look at their wallet, and I'd be like, I'll trade you for whatever card you wanna use.And I would motion towards the card, but I have, this is collateral, it sounds small, but these tiny things are like how use facilitate sales. So then they would then hand me the card they would use.And then yet again, I copied the card on because it's very easy for someone to fat finger number and then all of a sudden, I can't run the card later. So by turning it this way, I made sure that the card number was correct and put in the proper place on the contracts that we're in.If you did an iPad, it works the same way. If you do it on the, on the phone, you can have them \\[...0.7s\\] show you the card either way. And if you're not the one who's immediately processing transactions, you've got a separate finance team. This becomes more important, especially if there's any delay between purchase and running the transaction.This also avoids the, I don't have the card, I wanna use this, I don't have my wallet on me. It gets around all of that stuff.So just a pro tip, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, so first thing we do, we offer trials last. That's how I'd say always get a credit card, so you record their information, you hold on to the ID motion for the credit card, say what card you wanna use.Now \\[...0.5s\\] they have to leave, a card is a key point if they bulk, just say this is, this is exactly so ridiculous for me to say this. I believe it or not, you know uh, failed at closing a lot of free trials in the early days.I had a tough time. People come in for a 14 day trial \\[...0.5s\\] and, uh, I'd be like, awesome, let's get you signed up. And I'd be like, so what card you wanna use? They're like, you said it was free. I was like, \\[...0.5s\\] yeah, and they're like, well, I'll just, I'll give you my card after the 14 days.And I was like, \\[...0.5s\\] I mean um okay, I guess, and I didn't know what to do, so this line came out of my mouth, and then I, \\[...0.3s\\] I don't wanna say I literally never missed another trial again, but I really wanna say I never missed another trial again.So here's how it go, \\[...0.8s\\] they would say we do the whole contract and be like, awesome. What car can I put down? Just so I can complete your account profile. So one is, it's not to Bill it, it's just to complete your account profile, and if they bulked, and they're like, I thought this thing was free.I'm like, oh, 100% it is, \\[...0.4s\\] this is how we voice on it, \\[...0.7s\\] and by appealing to authority, this hypothetical person who makes policy and rules everyone just says okay, \\[...0.4s\\] and they just hand it to you. I have no idea why it works. I just know that it works and say this is how it's always on it.That's it, you just jogging, say \\[...0.4s\\] tie voice on it, always sell staying in peg, so remember at this point, it's actually a take away sale for you now. So they've agreed, they basically you try to sell them, and you're at the end, and they're like, there.It feels like they're, like, not as interested. Now you have to remember the leverage shifts, because now you're giving them stuff for free, they have to prove why they're deserved to get it after you said they had to pay for it.So you say, listen, I'm only gonna do this and extend this honor to you of me working for free to help you get this thing if you do some things for me.Alright, so you ask directly, so if this program got you the result, will you stay long term? If the person says no, fuck it, the whole point of the trial, the whole point of the thing is to get them as a customer if they're not interested in that fine.Now if you advertise a free trial, then you need to offer whatever you advertise, but the way I said, remember I use it last, that's not what I advertise.I offer it under terms. And so \\[...0.6s\\] you don't want them to begin with, if they don't agree a staying long term. And the reason I ask that is I don't want you to try it.I want you to get results and out of integrity, I wanna set realistic goals. You're not gonna hit your long term goals during this trial. Just to be really perfectly clear, but you will establish habits that will help you get there. And we're gonna help you do that for free, \\[...0.5s\\] but if you wanna get your long term results, you're gonna have to stay on after I just wanna make sure that you're not looking for some sort of quick fix.When you say it like that, people are like, got it. You're like, because listen, I can't ethically promise you that.And as soon as you say that, you now have the moral high ground, they can't say shit to you, all right, and so that's how you sell staying and paying. So now that you've said, okay, I'll do it for free. Everyone's like, okay, sure, sure, I'll do it for free, and you're like, no no, no, not so fast.Susan, \\[...0.8s\\] if you get the result, you stand, \\[...0.7s\\] okay. Do you think you're gonna accomplish this in the time period? You're gonna get progress, you're not gonna get your goal.I wanna set that expectation up front, so as long as you're comfortable this, I'm happy to give this little, this little test run, this kickstart for you, \\[...0.4s\\] but I'm only in this for the long term.Susan, I think, and I wanna ask you directly, are you in this for the long term? They say, yes, you're in, you have now sold the idea of them staying long term. If you can't sell that for free, one needed to work on, work on sales, but they also might just not be a good prospect.Step 4, so now you sell consumption commitment, so explain the fees after getting the card very key. So at this point in the sale, right, we've, we said cool, let's get the trial started.I have your ID, let's get the card, sign it, you stay, you sell the idea of staying long term awesome. Now once we have the card, we have the payment information, now we basically get agreement on terms. It's much easier to get agreement on terms post getting purchasing method rather than pre. I'm just giving you guys this off of years experience, just use it if you want.Alright, so I say something like this, \\[...0.9s\\] I see, listen, so we're gonna do our part as long as you do yours. And that's, that's fair, right okay, cool, so now I just ask that you bet on yourself, so if you miss or skip any stuff, your results are gonna suffer.So we charge to keep you on track. If you miss no big deal, you'll get dinged a little bit, but it's not gonna get you off track. It'll get you back on track with that little, that little ding.Alright, so if you follow through, you're gonna get all of this stuff that I told you earlier for free. So this is the best way that we can get you amazing result and keep it free for you. So it's the best of both worlds.Now that last line I used \\[...0.6s\\] more times than I can count, which is, this is the best way that I can get your results and still keep it free.The best of both worlds. I'd say that a lot of times it works. No, if you explain the fees before you get the card, you'll get way more resistance and way more like, what about this and why is this, this?If you explain it afterwards with the same like, this is just how we've always done it attitude, people will \\[...0.6s\\] agree or they'll tend to agree at a far higher likelihood.And the last point that I'll make is that I always have them initial next to each fee they're agreeing to, and so again, you don't wanna have like 19 sets of fees. You wanna have this few things as that are, that are important to you.So to usually be the sales consults they have to attend, whatever the key \\[...0.5s\\] metric for them getting results are.And maybe them doing some advertising for you, cause remember, you doing this for free, so they might as well do some advertising for you. They gotta post, they gotta, \\[...0.4s\\] you know, give you a testimonial at the end, whatever. So they have to agree to doing those things.If you're gonna give a free trial, get some stuff for it, that's the whole point of this. If you're gonna give, you should get. So that step 4 is that we get the card, then we explain the terms, then we have the initial next to all the fees that are associated.We explain why we have the fees, which is for their benefit. It's the only way we can still ethically tell you that we could help you get results and keep it free though. You get the best of both worlds done.Great. So now, \\[...1.1s\\] uh, I like making the check ins required. That's basically just an explanation of the fees. So I would say, alright, uh, yep, and you agree to attend each of these three check ins the first time, we do x so that you can, the second time we do y so that you can, the third time we do z so that you can.Obviously, we charge if you miss these three because it's the only way we can get your results. So this is me explaining how I would explain each of the kind of clauses that I'm having them initial next to. So this would be like the sales consults now again, I'm not gonna call them sales consults.I say, hey, you gotta attend nutrition so that we can fix your food. You gotta attend the progress meeting so that we can adjust the nutrition to keep the results coming, and you gotta attend the transformation meeting at the end, so you can get your after pictures. That should make sense, right.Yes, okay, cool, done. This is, like, there's not a lot to object to. There \\[...0.4s\\] question is okay, well, how do trials make me money? So this is how I upsell from a trial, but everything it is I went through is how my step by step process for selling a trial with penalty, which will get you far more customers and long term commitment. Then \\[...0.4s\\] just telling someone to put a card and wish for the best.So when someone takes a trial, one of three things happen. They like it, they hate it, or they don't use it. So here's how I upselling you to those scenarios. So if they like it, this is the easy one. You already set them up for automatic billing, cause it's a trial.Great, so meet with them anyways, during the transformation meeting, whatever meeting you wanna have close to the middle or close to the end, and you still offer the, the longer term, a higher value version of your service or both.Alright, so \\[...0.6s\\] again, they just didn't trust you enough in the beginning. Let's say you have three sales consultations, you sell different stuff or have potential for upgrades \\[...0.5s\\] at the first and the second you should, so absolutely pitch the next thing, cause now they're in, they've had a taste that the whole dynamic completely shifted.All right, it's a successful customers tend to get even more value, um, \\[...0.6s\\] out of your better and more profitable stuff.So it's ethical for you to make the offer for them, \\[...0.4s\\] if you can help, help. Now let's say they hate it, turn the frown upside down, so ask them what they would have liked to be different. Tell them they're totally right, and that you're angry at yourself for missing this.Do not blame it. Only one person can be angry, and it needs to be, you \\[...0.5s\\] ask if they'll give you a chance to make it up to them because of how outraged you are at their terrible experience.And now since you better understand their needs that they're a better fit for your new higher level thing, then offer them that, yes, this is a sale, \\[...0.6s\\] and yes, about half of people, believe it or not, by this, they come in for this retrial.They wanted more everything whatever, and you say that's on me, I suck. I'm so pissed for you, that should never have happened. I should have offered you this, and that's cause I didn't listen, and I should have listened better. So let me make it up to you, \\[...0.4s\\] ah, sell this thing now.Let's say they didn't use it. You reach out to people multiple times before you get to this point ideally. But when you do that, you explain that you need to meet with them.You offer to wave the fees, cause remember they signed, they were gonna do stuff. I don't want the 50 dollar fees, don't care at all. I do that just to hold them accountable, and I tell them that I offer to waive the fee if they get back on track.Right, so now you can get them back on track or \\[...0.6s\\] again offer something better. So I say me personally, I don't like billing non starters, cause it's, like, a great way to get 1 star reviews.I prefer not to have great ways to go on store reviews, and a small fee isn't worth that, but it's your choice. It's up to you. So I personally just use the fees as leverage to get them back in, because that's where I'm gonna get the long term lifetime value.A couple other tidbits, so to tweak, tweak your trial to get the most customers.If no one takes your trial, lower the requirements of the priorities. If people take your trial but don't follow through, emphasize explaining how the feasts help them, and make sure that you include meetings as mandatory, like, you have to highlight. That's why I have the little separate lines them to initial, and I walk through it with them.Don't let them read it, explain each one, get them nod, then initial, \\[...0.4s\\] all right, if people don't stay on the back end, better emphasize the value staying and paying.That's the early part where I said, hey, if we get you the results, would you stay? We added that back in \\[...0.4s\\] to our scripting when I saw my guys weren't doing it, and we weren't getting as many ascensions.We added it back in, and then way more trial started ascending. Let people make up for goofs, so people often get discouraged after getting billed, but you can offer the opportunity to make it up. So this does a great job of getting people back on track and converting.But if they miss that, you're justified in building them. So I don't see, like, if you, they miss something, you reach out, you reach out again, you say, hey, I'll make it, you know, I'll wave it, just come back in. If they miss the next one, \\[...1.3s\\] it's up to you.I usually don't, but that I think that is a completely, you're completely justified building at that point in terms of naming, just call it a trial. Just say we do it in a special way and the way we do it gets people results rather than not results.That's pretty much it. So even though the trial with penalty has some special features, you should just call it a trial. Um, otherwise people may get scared or confused and no one wants to be penalized.All right. If they ask you why you do free trials this way, just reply with, \\[...0.4s\\] it's how you've always done it. Payless now or pay more later versus trial with penalty.So I use Payless now or pay more later as a down cell for physical products or one time services. I use trial with penalty as a down cell recurring products or services. Also, I've only made this work in businesses where the customer has to do work to get results.So if you find other types of businesses that this works for these trials where they don't have to do anything, let me know. For the most part, though, it's usually when somebody has to do something oftentimes, like software usually have to do a lot of stuff in the software services. It's common for customers have to do a bunch of stuff.Um, that's more, that's more normal \\[...0.9s\\] discounts, uh, get card on file. So some people get weird when you offer free stuff and then ask for a card. And if you have a super low price, it justifies the card.So a small price, uh, means the car will probably work when automatic payment start. So instead of a free month, you might offer a first month for a first month for$1 or then X dollars per month when it occurs.And so if you want, you can offer for a buck, a dollar down,$10 down, whatever. Um, if you have a hard time with it, \\[...0.4s\\] anybody who has any acumen in sales should never have an issue closing a free trial with a card.Personally, rebates are a little tougher, uh, but they work the same way. You just get them to pay up front. So I consider rebates similar to win your money back, but usually for smaller, like smaller scope. So just get them to do the thing you need them to do and then they get the rebate.So that was kind of, like, the, the story that I gave with Layla. So she paid, you know, 500 bucks. She had attend two webinars or three webinars, \\[...0.4s\\] very clear, very small, very straightforward.That's where rebates are kind of nice, \\[...0.4s\\] um, rather than, you know, Billy. Because the thing is the rebate, you know, the card works because you, they paid for it, then they get it rebated, which is basically a rollover onto their service afterwards. So those are the important points.Quick summary in a trial with penalty offer, customers can try our product or service for free so long as they meet your terms.A trial with penalty downsell offers get yeses from people who would have said no to do them. You get the card, get the commitment, explain why they have to do it to get the results, the meetings they have to attend, and what happens if they don't do it. And use the same refund criteria \\[...0.5s\\] from your win your money back. The attraction offer No. 1 to create your trial with penalty criteria.This way at the end of the trial, they've done the stuff that makes a great long term customer, and they advertise your business for you, breaking fees. You can charge by criteria, or you can charge a lump fee.I like breaking them up, so you can either say it's$50 for each of these occurrences, or you can just say if you mess up any of these, you pay the full boat.I prefer the small dings \\[...0.6s\\] because then people are like, oh, I missed one, now I shouldn't even try, right? I don't like that. You make money by getting people results and turning them into customers, not nickelindying them with fees.My personal opinion. So use mid to trial check ins to make more offers. If they love it, give them more of what they love. If they have problems, swap it for what makes sense for them. If they aren't using it, offer the ability to make it up to avoid the fees.This style of trial converts as much or much higher percentage on the backend, which is why I do them.It retains goodwill because you actually look like you're trying to help which you are, \\[...0.4s\\] and you get agreement before explaining the fees, just as a quick reminder, cause it's super important, and you can always do normal trial as a down, down cell and remove that.But at that point, I don't think that person really is, they're just trying to leave. Um, and remember everyone buy something \\[...1.5s\\] that's free trials. \\[...1.9s\\] So we just covered payment plans \\[...0.4s\\] and free trials or trial with penalties, whatever you wanna say it.Now we have the third and final of the downsell offers, which I like to call feature downsells.Let's begin \\[...0.7s\\] the same 5 high Learned description examples in born points and summary. Look how clean this drawing was so nice. Okay, so fundamentally you wanna buy the thing. No, it's too much. I remove some features. I say, how about now? That's how this works.Alright. So how I Learned it? A friend of mine told me that he had 3 X's closed rate last quarter from 25% to 75%.And I was like, what on God's earth did you do? And so I asked him if he used to pay the plane or discount. He said, neither. And I was like, \\[...0.5s\\] okay, how does that work? He said, he lowered his price by removing a feature. And I was like, well, what feature did you remove? He said, my guarantee.I was like, what he said, yeah, so \\[...0.7s\\] I have my 4,000 dollar thing. And then people say, uh, no, I can't afford that. And he says, no worries, she said, I can do it for 2,000 dollars. I just won't give you a guarantee.And then what happens is people see the value of the guarantee now and then they re close themselves on the higher priced offer. And so we went from 25 out of 100 people buying the expensive thing to 35 buying an expensive thing and 40 buying the down sell. That's how I Learned the feature down sell process, \\[...0.7s\\] so here's the description. So feature down sales lower prices by changing with the customers yet.So here we're actually lowering prices. The, all the other examples were changing terms. Here we lower prices, \\[...0.4s\\] and I do them by offering less quantity, less quality, lower price alternatives or cutting optional components.So all features have a price and a value, this is where it gets really, really slick. If you remove something, the price goes down, sure, but the value goes down too. So what features you remove and how much you lower the price affects how good of a deal the person gets.So this changes in your offer's price to value affects how people buy. So people wanna get the best deal for them, and so if you remove stuff they hate and then lower the price a lot, they get a great deal. If you remove stuff they love and lower the price a little, they get a worse deal.And this is where the science of feature downselling becomes really, really sexy.Alright, so \\[...0.4s\\] people will see the value in the thing you removed after they see the difference in price, as in, people will weigh how much money they save against how much value they lose. So feature downselling gets customers to re upsell themselves on the more expensive offers.So this means that you wanna remove features from highest to lowest value, \\[...0.4s\\] since people want more value for their money. This incentivizes customers to get the highest value purchase for them.Feature downsells have a simple formula, take something away, lower the price, and in so many words, ask how about now.So let's do some examples, so let's say we're downselling product and service quality. So for services, this might mean a lower amount, fewer sessions, less time, shorter duration. For products, it might mean fewer of them.Alright, so a product quantity down, so would be, hey, instead of a three month supply, how about we start with the just one month supply? A service quality down, so might be saying instead of four sessions a month, why don't we start you at two sessions a month? So this is service and quantity.Alright, so let's talk about product quality, so here's how we would down, so you think about older versions, less reliable materials, materials of lower social status, \\[...0.7s\\] etc.Alright, so product quality, say, instead of set of leather seats, how do vinyl seats work? How's that sound feature down selling? Service quality is a little more complex because there's a whole bunch of them.Alright, so this means a lot of things and I'll give you a few ways that I change the quality of services.And the hint is that this always works to increase service qualities. Well, so you can go the other directions while when you're thinking about each of these vectors of quality for services, you can make your more expensive thing have more of these.Alright, so instead of a 5 minute response time, why don't we just start you at overnight response times? You'll still save some money and you'll get your answers just for the small delay. Here are some more service quality features.So time availability, so specific times versus whenever you want. Whenever you want is obviously more valuable. So if you're downsell, you'd say, alright, well, you can only come on these office hours rather than whenever you want.So days of week, so that would be Monday, Wednesday, Friday versus all days. It could be times of day, so 9 to 5 versus 24 hours. It could be amount of times you get 15 minutes of protocols versus sir, 60 minutes of protocols.It could be location availability. This is where one location versus all locations we own. It could be cancellations, which means you can have rescheduled fees or it's free for you to reschedule. Ah, speed of response, you can reply minutes versus hours versus days.Speed of delivery. So you can wait in line versus party versus same day versus next day versus next week. These are all different \\[...0.4s\\] service ratio one on one, one on many, many to 1, which is the ultimate version is I've many of my team numbers on one person \\[...0.5s\\] communication method.So tech support versus chat support versus video support, you've got provider qualification. So is it the owner, a longtime employee or a new employee who's super Junior? Is it live versus recorded?So you can watch it happen now or watch it after it happens later. You get it in person versus remote. Would you rather have be here in person with me or watch it somewhere else? Would you rather have do it yourself? Would you have us do it with you?Would you rather us do it for you? Uh, expiration, so this thing works forever, or this is only works X times or only works at specific times \\[...0.4s\\] personalization. Do you want it generic? You want it made just for you?Insurance guarantees, so this is, uh, think of, like, lengths of time, so this works for 1 year or for life in terms of the guarantee, so coverage, this works, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, when specific bad thing happens, or works when any bad thing happens.Uh, terms unconditional or only if you do X, y, and Z, it's a conditional, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, guarantee. So all of those things are quality service down cells, which you can also flip into up cells. But if you're thinking about, like, man, how do I make my, how do I, how do I remove features?Well, you probably haven't even quantified half of these for yourself, so quantify what your service expectations are. You don't need to mention any of this stuff to somebody, but when you wanna start peeling things back, you then tell them what it is and then remove it.So downselling by removing entire features, so rather than lowering quantity or quality, remove the feature itself.So in the story, he removed a guarantee, so instead of priory chat support, email support and calls, why don't we just keep it to chat and email support, but drop the calls to save you some money.You still get your answers, it'll save us some time. We'll get past your savings owned to you, so we remove this stuff, and then they can keep that stuff for a lower price. So feature downselling done for you to do it yourself.So this is a key one, this probably happens for a lot of service businesses. So some of you guys have, like, online trainings and things like that one too many \\[...0.4s\\] that you were like, hey, what if I downsell something else?Most of the times, you should just ignore it. But if you do insist, here's a way to do it. So if someone says no to all your service downsells, you can downsell another product that solves the same problem.So for chiropractor, for example, you say, hey, instead of chiropractor judgments, let's just start you with some tools. You can do it yourself \\[...0.4s\\] at home. Then \\[...0.4s\\] you'd sell \\[...0.4s\\] home massage tools, foam rollers, mats, etc.So this is just like the no sale, sale that I had in the supplement thing where someone doesn't come in, they don't wanna buy the service to say, fine, we'll do Nutrition Council and then we sell them the do it yourself version, which was the at home thumb drive \\[...0.4s\\] with nutritional support. But if you're gonna do this other thing, what happens?You open up a whole another can of problems that we get to solve through them buying more stuff. If you're a painter, well, if you can't afford me painting your house, why don't I just give you the paint and let you lease one of our spray machines for daily use?Easy down. So Alex Ramozzi, instead of me and my team buying your company and actively growing your business, why don't you just attend a workshop? Cough, good acquisition account, right, that's the idea, so done for use me and my whole team doing everything we possibly can for good forever.Well, if I peel that back to you, okay, well, \\[...0.4s\\] just come to a workshop, and you get a couple days, and we're gonna look at all the things that we would do. We'll tell you exactly we do, but it would be in an hour rather than for life. It's two days, the hour is if you're with one of our experts.Okay, so let's do important points, \\[...0.4s\\] so remember, \\[...0.5s\\] never, \\[...0.5s\\] never negotiate price, maintain the position of a helpful guide somewhere feature down selling means trying to find the best deal for them.You can have unlimited shots on goal with a customer, as long as you remain helpful. You're, like, totally understand. Let's see if we can figure out something that work for you. No one's offended by that.If you're like, oh, if you don't do that, do this, it's like, it feels a little, \\[...0.4s\\] feels a little icky, so you just wanna keep that frame back foot of, like, let's just find something that works for you man. Tweak, okay, this is \\[...1.1s\\] important, \\[...0.4s\\] so tweak your feature downsaw process.So we have the job of making the product have the highest value to cost in the eyes of the customer.But in the beginning, you won't know much about your customer preferences. So as you solve the same problems for the same type of customer, you wanna learn what they find the most viable, and then you'll start standardizing it. Because if everyone has the same \\[...0.4s\\] order of \\[...0.6s\\] importance or preference, then when you remove things, you can remove things in a specific order.Like my friend remove the guarantee, and you knew that that got the highest amount of uptakes. Alright, so here's how I standardize my doubtsaw process.So first, I cut something valuable and lower the price a little bit. Alright, so that's exactly what he did. So he had his guarantee thing, he lowered the price. Now I said two thousand.I don't remember where he lowered his prices, but if, let's say it was four red \\[...0.4s\\] and he says, okay, well, remove the guarantee and offer for thirty five hundred \\[...0.5s\\] because it's a tiny amount different, and I took something really valuable away. They're like, oh no, I'd rather have this.So they reopsell themselves because I took something really valuable and decreased the price a little.Now \\[...0.4s\\] at this point, if they say no to that, I do this to get well, I do that to get them to reconsider the original price. If that fails, I continue removing features and lowering prices until they buy. So I'd rather have people get something rather than getting nothing.Now at this point, the next feature I typically remove, I would have a big decrease in price because now I'm saying, okay, this might be a price issue. So now I'm gonna try and take away things that they don't care about with a big decrease in price. And now I'm increasing the value.So basically the first one is like a hip check \\[...0.4s\\] of like \\[...0.5s\\] big valuable thing like a guarantee, tiny decrease in price.They re up sell. They don't re up sell. They say, hey, let's put the guarantee back in and let's \\[...0.5s\\] take this other feature away and take a massive amount off the price. And then at that point, they're like, oh, wow, less of this thing I don't care about and way lower price sounds good to me \\[...0.4s\\] right now.If you want, you can start naming your feature combination, first class, Business class, economy as you remove features and change prices. Now I prefer to name my cheapest combination, remember the rental car story the minimum.So I like it because implies that they have to get at least that thing. And if someone rejects all of the packages, I just say, so nothing more than the minimum package, then \\[...0.5s\\] same as they told me. And we do that because it always only works, uh, \\[...1.0s\\] doesn't always work, but it's, uh, it's very effective.Okay, so just like we have our temperature check during the payment plan down cell process, we also have a temperature check during the feature down cell process. So if you make two changes in a row and they still refuse, make sure they still want the thing.You still say the same, hey, real quick, just to make sure that we're on the same, same scale here. Uh, 1 to 10, how bad you want this thing now again, if they say 8 to 10, cool, we're gonna figure out something that'll work for you.They say less than 10, it's like, hey, maybe I need to reconfigure this thing or let's just figure out different terms of payment, and you actually \\[...0.8s\\] cross out back to the payment plan down cells. So 8 or above \\[...0.8s\\] start paying plan down selling. After each down sell, ask deal or fair enough.And this is something that I've just found that works ridiculously well with feature down cells or payoplane down cells. Is that \\[...0.6s\\] it's, you're fundamentally, kind of, like, a barter mode, not a bad way. It's just like, hey, let me make this work for you, so if we did this, would that work for you? Right, that sound fair \\[...0.6s\\] that it, like deal that work.When you say those types of things, people have a hard time \\[...0.8s\\] denying reciprocity, and so \\[...0.4s\\] you say, \\[...0.7s\\] I want this thing, you say got it, I will meet your, I will meet your terms, I will remove this thing, but now you will meet my price, fair enough.And if you do that two or three times, it's very hard for people to say no, because \\[...0.4s\\] they, it's hard for them to say no, that's not fair, \\[...0.4s\\] and my podcast episode 2:02, I give a full verbal breakdown of exactly how I say this with tonality. So if you wanna listen to my podcast \\[...0.4s\\] episode 2.0. 2 Alchemazy the game, uh, you can listen to me actually walking this through, and so if you've got sales guys who do down cells, like, highly recommend now, um, free orientations boost do it yourself feature down cells.So let me explain what I mean, so I ask, so even though we're not gonna work together, so this is like, now they're they're not, they're not buying anything on X I still wanna help.This is, like, the nutrition thing, \\[...0.3s\\] how about you just come to a free orientation on X tomorrow? At the end of the orientation, I offer a DIY product that solves the same problem as the done for you services just at lower price.So I could also say come to our home painters orientation, and so at the home painting orientation, I could then sell the daily rental of my machines and some buckets of paint for them go do it.Right, that's the idea. So we just have another way, another version of our offer that doesn't take much time from us for them to do and still pass. Now, um, just as little pro tips here, highly recommend feature downselling your guarantee, tiny decrease in price, remove guarantee, many people re upsell themselves. And you can also feature downsell current customers.So this is a pro tip. So we found across our portfolio company something really interesting. So when we compared LTV across all service segments, there was a service segment that was \\[...0.5s\\] unbeknownst to me that was the second highest LTV. And the reason that it was unbeknownst to me or interesting was that they were at a far lower price.So typically the highest LTV customers are the ones that pay the most. But in this instance, the CHRN was so low on these low to mid priced customers that \\[...0.5s\\] they \\[...0.6s\\] ended up being worth a lot of money.And so this is what was different about this particular customer group. The customers that we \\[...0.6s\\] in our companies had proactively went to. This is after we've already sold them stuff, said, hey, you're only using four out of the six services that we offer, or you're only using four out of the six features.Did you know that you can get these four features at this lower rate? People are like, oh \\[...0.9s\\] no, I didn't know that.And as soon as we say, wait, why don't I just go ahead and take care of that for you and I'll just lower you to this rate, that way you have the better deal for you, those people \\[...0.4s\\] never leave.So if you have people, \\[...0.4s\\] there's this big mystery was like, why would it just? Hopefully, I just build them as long as I can \\[...0.9s\\] no \\[...0.9s\\] find the like, hey, I get where you're coming from.This blew my mind, which is why I'm sharing it with you. If you see people aren't using your stuff, they're going to cancel.And I have tons of data to support this on the gym side. I'm sure it across, \\[...0.4s\\] it works across all businesses, but if people don't consume the stuff, they cancel at a much faster rate, and so it's much easier to just adjust down the price to match what they actually use. Cause that's what they're actually getting value from. And then they're like, wow, these guys are ethical and honest. They proactively asked me to pay less.I love these guys. They went from being like, I might cancel cause I'm not using some of this stuff to these guys are amazing, because they initiated it, so sure, you can do this on a cancellation call. That's, kind of like a last chance, but you get the goodwill if you do it by you reaching out to them. And this is the last one that I love. This is the only way \\[...0.4s\\] that you can lower your price.Alright, so you can quote me here. This is the, the big exception that you can lower your price without changing what you give them, \\[...0.5s\\] and that's because \\[...0.4s\\] you change what they give you.So let's say I have a 500 dollar thing \\[...0.6s\\] and they say, I just absolutely cannot afford anything less than 400 dollars. I say, totally understand, \\[...0.6s\\] but for$400 you would do it?Yes, okay, I will accept that under these terms. So now I've changed the offer. I say \\[...0.5s\\] I'll do that if you \\[...0.4s\\] leave me reviews on all these sites, you leave me testimonials, you post every day, and you send me two referrals \\[...0.4s\\] right now, \\[...0.7s\\] introduce me to two people by doing this. \\[...1.0s\\]I then trade$100 \\[...0.4s\\] for what is hopefully more valuable to me than a hundred dollars of advertising. And so every person can do other stuff. And so fundamentally this is price plus barter.So if somebody comes to me and I did this, if somebody comes to me and says, hey, Susan signed up for$400 and I sent it for$600, so I'm like, oh, \\[...0.7s\\] do you wanna do what Susan did?Cause I would love that \\[...0.4s\\] because Susan cleans my gym for me everyday, and she also introduced me to 3 of her friends that she post on Facebook everyday. Do you wanna do that? We can get you set up right now. They're like, oh, \\[...0.8s\\] I'll keep the 600, oh my god, no worries.So you absolutely have your ass covered, because these are the terms under which Susan did pay less.And so if someone absolutely no way can pay less barter, because there's always some things that they can do for you. And most of the time that's gonna be the form of advertising. They can leave your reviews, they can leave your testimonials, and they can send you friends.So \\[...0.4s\\] summary, so feature down sales, lower prices by removing stuff. You take something away, lower the price, can ask how about now typical feature down sales, offer less quantity, less quality, cheaper alternatives or remove features altogether.People tend to see the value in what you removed after they see the price difference, \\[...0.3s\\] you may get more people to take the more expensive up by doing it this way. If you remove stuff they hate and lower the price, a lot people, more people take the down.So \\[...0.4s\\] if you move stuff they love and lower the price, a little more people take the original offer.So the first down cell gets them to reconsider my first offer, the rest of my down cells get them to consider the best deal for them. If a prospect rejects multiple down cells, see if they still want your thing before continuing.This is the 8 to 10 thing if a prospect likes a combination of features but still doesn't like the price, start payment plan downselling, which is very effective at this point, cause now you really got this thing right for those, like okay, this is a suite of features, this is the price, like, no, this is everything I want, I just can't afford it. Like, can you afford it in general or not afford it today?They're like, today cool, then let's break this out. How can you do half now, half you get paid, and you go down that path. Now you can feature downsell existing customers before they cancel, which actually extends the LTV, and you can discount customers in exchange for them advertising your business.Those are featured downsells and finishes or concludes \\[...0.4s\\] our downsell offer section. And in the next and final of the 4\\. 4 prongs, we talk about continuity offers."

    "content": "\\[...2.6s\\]How businesses make money, \\[...0.6s\\] how businesses make money \\[...0.6s\\] starting with No. 1, LTP has to be greater than CAC, \\[...0.4s\\] duh, but let's get into it. Oh, look, I did write this, duh, haha. So you've gotta make more money over the lifespan of the customer that it cost you to get them.Obviously, cause otherwise you're spending money to get people who give you less money than it cost you to get them, which is not a good recipe for making money.So cool thing, No. 1, I'm glad we covered that. No. 2, let me give you this a real example to make this, make this real for you. So this is a real thing for me. So I had a meals company for a year or two, um, and \\[...0.6s\\] foreshadowing things went wrong.So we had 1 hundred dollar cash, which means it cost me 100 dollars to get a customer, and we had 5 hundred dollars of lifetime revenue.I'm highlighting this lifetime revenue, \\[...0.9s\\] and I was like, and so my team comes to me and says, hey, we're gonna be rich. Every hundred dollars you put in, we get$500 back.Let's spend more money. And I was like, hold on one second \\[...0.8s\\] and so \\[...0.5s\\] not so fast. I was like okay, well, what are our gross margins on these meals? And so the gross margins were 20%, so in our lifetime revenue was 1.65\\* 3, meaning people would pay for hundred$65 a week for the meals and they would pay for three weeks. Okay, so the 30 day gross profit \\[...0.4s\\] was, uh, was, um, sorry, this is per month, excuse me. Uh, so 1\\. 65 times 20% is$33. So \\[...0.4s\\] now my lifetime gross profit was 500 times 20% was$100. \\[...1.1s\\]So wait a second, so you're saying \\[...0.5s\\] I'm spending 100, making$33 back in the first month and spending a hundred and making a hundred dollars back lifetime. But then we have like all these humans that we have to do all this other stuff with as well.Well, that's not gonna work very well. And so it did it. And so I told them to not do that. It's also why I'm not in the meals business anymore. Um, now to be like, hey, why didn't you work to figure it out?It was the fourth business I started while I was still CEO. And \\[...0.7s\\] Layla and I had one of these conversations. She's like, pick, it's like, legit. And so I ended up shutting down cause I had a co packer. So it wasn't like, I had a huge amount \\[...0.4s\\] of staff or something that I had to lay off or anything like that.I was repurposing my supplement company staff to deal with all the meal stuff. Here's a fun fact for you, 80% of our customer complaints came from meals, 20% from supplements, and 95% of my profits came from supplements and 5% came from meals. And I was like, \\[...0.5s\\] I think if I were giving me advice, I would advise me to stop doing this. And so I did.So let me give you some benchmarks though, so you have an idea extra, like okay, got it. So LTB, \\[...0.8s\\] lt, \\[...0.5s\\] that's just AGP, not PG. So it's not a PG thirteen movie lifetime gross profit.2. CAC ratio should be over 3 to 1, which means you should be able to make more than three times what it cost you to get a customer in gross profit.Not revenue, \\[...0.6s\\] gross profit \\[...0.4s\\] back to you as a business owner, right? At minimum in order to have a profitable business, at minimum, this is not like that's the goal. This is the, by all means, if you're below this, you're absolutely screwed. At 3, you're still not like in great, you know, in a great position. Ideally it's much higher.Okay, here's the example gone better. So in order for this CAC to work for this business, I would have to make 15 dollars, not five hundred dollars in lifetime gross profit in order for this to make sense. So I had to be way higher in order for this to work and it wasn't.Okay. So \\[...0.4s\\] that's just to give you an idea of what kind of adjustments I would have to make in order to make that business work, which I was like, I don't know if I can conceivably do that, which ultimately LED to me deciding not to, which then leads us to the only three numbers that matters. And this is what you need to write down.This is what you need to think with. Alright, now this is not in the book and you're like, wait a second, how are you not talking about this in the book? It's cause no one can do math. So you're here \\[...0.4s\\] and \\[...0.8s\\] you can do math.So if you're looking closely, you may notice that there's three numbers that make the biggest difference here.All right, so number one is CAC, which is the cost you are customer.The second is the fact that I talked about this 30 day thing, like why am I talking about 30 days?And the third is gross profit, \\[...0.9s\\] which those three metrics triangulate. Acquisition meaning getting new customers. CAC is how much it costs, \\[...0.6s\\] GP is to make a profit, \\[...0.4s\\] and short PPD means payback period, how long it takes you to make that money back, how long it takes you to make your cost back. \\[...1.1s\\]So ideally you get \\[...0.5s\\] have low CAC which means you have cheap customers, you have high GP who pay you lots of money, and then short payback period, which means really fast.Outcome is more money faster. \\[...1.8s\\] Alright, and that's pretty much the trading in this book. Alright, like, that's what this is all about. So that's, that's what we accomplish the rest of this is all about how.Okay, so boom, those are the three numbers that matter. And let's get into the first one a little bit more detail.Some of you guys are like, \\[...0.4s\\] CAC sounds like something my cat threw up. Understood. That's the next one, \\[...1.0s\\] 100 million Dollar Money models, the training on how to make money. We're gonna be covering all of this stuff in the next few hours together.You'll also notice that some of these things correspond with the chapters of the book 100 Million Dollar Money Models.You'll also know that some of these things are not included in the book. And that is because some of these things are extras. They are Easter eggs. They're my gift to you for actually making it over to the internet where you can watch with your eyeballs and listen with your earballs.I will have things that are additional \\[...0.6s\\] to the book chapters that go in a little bit more depth because with a book, you have to be super, super constrained in terms of the tension. With videos, it can be a little bit more engaging.And so I cover a little few more examples few different examples and add in some chapters that I ended up cutting out in the final version. So \\[...0.6s\\] enjoy. With that being said, \\[...0.4s\\] let's get in context, \\[...0.4s\\] context context. The purpose.So \\[...0.7s\\] why does this book exist? The hundred billion dollar offers books answered the first question. What do I sell? Because if you have nothing to sell, there's nothing you can do now from there. Once you have something to sell, you need somebody to sell it too.Because you still can't get money unless you have a person who gives you that money.Great, 100 million dollar leads answer that question, which is how to get strangers to wanna buy your stuff, which the subtitle of that is advertising and the core 4 and lead getters and all the things we go into in that book. So why does money models exist?Well, money models exist between both of these books, which is how to monetize. If you have something to sell and you have people to sell to, then you have the, okay, well, how do I get them to give me money? How do I get them to buy more stuff for me? How do I actually make a profit from this? And how do I profitably advertise in order to let even more people know? All of those questions were answered in this book.And to give you a little bit of Baxter on this really quickly, I wrote this book \\[...0.4s\\] first and it was because this was my cookbook for making money.This was all the tricks that I knew about making a business make more money. But then I was like, okay, I can't wait to release this thing. And then I realized, oh, shoot. Unless they know to advertise, they're not gonna be able to use any of the stuff in the book. So I was like, okay, I gotta start writing this book on leads and advertising.And as I was writing this book on leads and advertising, I was like, oh crap, if they don't have anything to advertise, they're not gonna be able to use this book.So then I had to write leads. So ended up having to write two books in order to get to this third book in the trilogy, which I'm excited to share with you now.So \\[...0.4s\\] why do I write these books? This is little Isaac Newton, if I have seen further than others. It is by standing upon the shoulders of giants. And so my goal is to pass as much on \\[...0.4s\\] to you as I possibly can and hopefully make you lots and lots of money. And maybe someday you hit me up and say, hey, can you invest my company? And I'll be happy to do that, otherwise, just make money.I'm gonna die, so are you, and at least we can share some stuff, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, big picture, we're all here because other people in the past documented what they did for generations. We may not remember the names, but we do pass on the learnings, and that's, kind of my goal here.And so education is the greatest legacy of all. That's why I make all the stuff that I make. Alright, so consider the alternative, you live a life amassing education, and then you die, \\[...0.4s\\] and then everyone has to relearn what you Learned. Everyone suffers what you suffered, what a waste of a life.And so I do this while I grow, because I don't wanna forget the little details \\[...0.4s\\] at the end of my life. Cause some people like, oh, I'm gonna document it at the end, it's like, we're gonna forget all the details by that. And so I try and make as much stuff as I can as I go up. \\[...1.2s\\]Bread crumbs, if you will. Simple skills are easy to teach. Complex skills often include some type of mentor or apprentice relationship for years to transfer knowledge.So think about like deal making, surgery scientists, those are things that usually are complex skills. But it's more so that there's just bundled terms that have many skills underneath of them.And so \\[...0.6s\\] it's more that people have a harder time qualifying it than it is that they are complex versus simple. But the thing is that there's not very many apprenticeships for business. This is the problem, right?And so my books and my trainings are my attempt to mimic apprenticeship at scale. So \\[...0.5s\\] here's the problem this book solves. Most advertising isn't profitable aka people lose money getting customers. And so let me explain how this works.Let's say you make$1,000 in profit per customer over the lifetime. So this will be a lifetime gross profit of a thousand bucks. And it cost you$100 to get a customer. That's CAC cost you acquire customer CAC.So lggb is 1,000 Cacs, 100, lggb 2 CAC, which is ratio is 10 to 1, which means for every dollar you put in you get$10 back out. Now you should make that trade every time, \\[...1.0s\\] but \\[...1.0s\\] what if you make the thousand dollars in a bulk payment 12 months later?Well, shoot, so that means you put$100 out today and then you do all this work and then you get paid a year later. \\[...1.1s\\]Well, you should still make the trade, \\[...0.5s\\] but \\[...0.4s\\] you're gonna have a lot of cash flow problems, right? So you have your negative hundred day one or month zero, \\[...0.5s\\] and then you're still losing money all this time delivering to the customer, and then finally they pay at the end.It could be equally said that let's say if we had a 10 year LTV and someone paid you$100 a year for, you know, eight dollars and thirty three cents a month for the next 10 years, you should totally make that deal.You're still not gonna have any money, even be profitable until month 13\\. You would either have to \\[...0.6s\\] burn your own savings, \\[...0.5s\\] which sucks. You'd have to burn other people savings through debt and equity, meaning you sell portions of your business in order to get more cash.You do fund raising, right? Or you raise some sort of loan from a bank so that they can basically fund your business while you wait to get this money back from customers, which sucks. And it's hard, \\[...0.9s\\] and I get it because I've been there. But the good news is there is a better way, \\[...0.6s\\] which is door \\[...0.4s\\] three.Uh, make more than$100 in profit in the first 30 days for this particular instance. And so this book is door three.So \\[...0.8s\\] if the problem is that most advertising is profitable, the solution is something I call client finance acquisition or customer finance acquisition. CFA is sometimes what I refer to as. And the point of that is to make money \\[...0.4s\\] faster.This enters the element of speed into the conversation. Not just how much you spend, how much you make back, but how fast you make it back. Because how fast you make it back can be the thing that unlocks all the growth in your business or takes your business overnight.So \\[...0.4s\\] customer finance acquisition or client finance acquisition. CFA is a process in which gross profit generate from a single client within the first 30 days is greater than cost of acquiring that customer.So where \\[...0.8s\\] gross profit, \\[...0.4s\\] the extra cash that you make from somebody coming into your business \\[...0.6s\\] from one customer in the first month is more than the cost of getting that customer. Now if you're \\[...0.4s\\] listening or following one from book, this isn't in the book.And the reason for that is that everything out of my proof readers, as soon as I start getting into math, they're like, I don't know if people are gonna be able to, like, follow along with that.And so I ended up just cutting the math sections from the book, but they are here because it's important. So \\[...0.7s\\] the purpose of this is to accomplish customer finance acquisition.So here's a quick story for you, so let me tell you how this all started. So this is me when I signed my first lease at$5,000 a month. That's me not knowing what I was doing and this is where I slept and that's my really fancy equipment that I was able to afford. Um, and so I heard about this thing called Facebook Marketing and things are going well.This is actually a picture I sent to my dad after the first week of having my gym to show how many memberships.I actually was very proud of this, which is kind of silly now that I look at. It's like I had like, whatever 18 memberships, but I was super proud of this. I'd hustled all day to get that, and so the thing is that thing started to grow, \\[...0.4s\\] and so that was good.This is our, my one year. There's my little, my little dinky streamers cause that's what I could afford at the time. Um, but things were going well, like all my client showed up, which is kind of sweet. Um, and we go over to 9+ employees, so that was cool. Um. And I started feel like I had to figure it out.I'm a businessman and then of course, Facebook slaps me \\[...0.4s\\] and they 5 x my cost per lead.And so what was once a money, \\[...0.4s\\] you know, torrential Hurricane or downpour turned into the Sahara Desert or whatever desert this is. Uh, and all I could think about was, you know, having to call my dad say, I'm gonna be I'm a failure this is actually didn't work. I didn't really know what I was doing and that would have sucked, right?And so all I could think about was how can I afford to pay for more leads? Right? Like the business worked, everything was fine. So my cost for lead went up. And so I needed something that was immediate cash up front so I could pay off my credit card Bill for the ads bent without going into debt.And so on a pilot, one key point right now is that two types of business owners. One type of business owner tries to keep figuring out and being upset about the things that \\[...0.5s\\] are out of their control of yours.If CPM's, the cost per impression goes up on a platform, you can either afford the impressions, you can't, you can beg borrow and steal and wish that the impression cost goes down, but it's not gonna change anything, right?Of course, you can make better ads, you make better hooks, things like that, but fundamentally my lead cost went up. So you can either go out of business or you can try and figure out a way to make more money per customer. And so that's what we did.All right, and so this would happen, so I'm traveling home for the holidays, \\[...0.4s\\] and I got this layover somewhere, and I see a guy from college \\[...0.4s\\] in the same waiting area, and I was like, oh no, shoot. I was like, hey, what's up, dude?So we start chatting, and it turned out that he started a supplement business. I was like, oh, okay, kind of interesting. And so I was like, hey, so how do you make?How much do you make a month from your supplement company? He's like, well, I got two locations, one does about 80,000 a month, the other is 130,000 a month. And I was like, \\[...1.1s\\] a month, it's like selling supplements. \\[...1.0s\\]And, \\[...1.0s\\] and I was like, hold on, I was like, if this guy \\[...0.5s\\] can make an extra 80,000 a month selling supplement without any members.I got a gym, he has no gym. I've got a gym with members, he does have members. I was like, I can definitely sell 20 grand a month with my members just to cover my costs. And so I put in order for supplements to resell my gym.And at first, of course, no unbut until one day I was able to make a sale. And then from that day and going forward, I began selling$200 per person in supplements, so about a hundred bucks in profit. And that hundred dollars offset my cost of getting new member in the door.And so I used to have to spend money to get the person in the door and then sell them stuff and then wait to get, you know, recruit membership costs, etc. But here with the supplements, I could sell supplements up front, and I made my cost to get the customer back.Alright, so I was able to start spending \\[...0.4s\\] way more money on ads again, because it paid for my advertising, and so it made all the new members and the cash they paid free, which is sweet.And so the moral is that I made another offer, and when I made another offer, I made more money. And so the outcome was I was able to get paid to get new customers, and I'll say that again, I was able to get paid to get new customers so most people pay to get customers.I was getting paid to grow, \\[...0.6s\\] and so my gyms grow. It's over time, I continue to get better and better at re combining the way I charged and structure my client journey to make more money than my competitors.And so I went from making like 4 to 5 to 1 to making 31 and up, so like, every dollar put in, I would get$30$40 back on my marketing. And I'll show you how I did it. Alright, so I eventually took that multi step money model and licensed everything about it to 5000+ locations.And that's what became Gym Launch and the average return on ad spend in the first 30 days across all those gyms, all right, not including memberships to this day is 4 to 1\\. And that's up front, that doesn't include membership.So that's not a true LTV to cash ratio saying that's the up front \\[...0.5s\\] cash they collect in the first 30 days \\[...0.4s\\] from customers. They still have the whole membership \\[...0.5s\\] on the back. \\[...1.1s\\]And so that's what I'm gonna break down for you in this training. Alright, which is exactly how to do that at any business, which is build a money model that allows you to never use your own money \\[...0.4s\\] to get customers again, alright, that means that you're no longer constrained by how much capital you have, who, you know, what your bank lending terms are.It's just about what you can design in terms of how you build your money model so that you can use other people's money, not banks, but your other customers money to finance your growth. \\[...1.1s\\]So that was my quick story, \\[...0.4s\\] all right, \\[...0.5s\\] and \\[...0.9s\\] we have given you context. Now we begin \\[...0.5s\\] how businesses make money. \\[...1.7s\\] So cost you acquire customer aka cack. Let's dive in \\[...0.5s\\] cost require customer again. So let's start with definition, \\[...0.8s\\] alright, cost require customer, all the cost require to sell a new customer.So that's the advertising dollars payroll to media buyer, creative team software that you, that the team uses to make advertising and sales commissions, salaries, the managers of those teams, everything that it costs you. So a lot of people. And if you want, you can delineate how much does it cost.If you use pay dads, for example, how much it costs us in media spend versus how much is our, sometimes people call it fully loaded CAC. Uh, you can have both those numbers separated out, which I think is wise, kind of like media CAC versus fully loaded. Uh, but at the very basics, now that only really applies to paid media.If you acquire customers via outbound, pay roll is gonna be the majority of your CAC. If you use, uh, content to get customers as your primary acquisition, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, method, then it's just gonna be the cost of the payroll for the team that does all the distribution of content and editing and what not.But most companies, especially if you're bigger, are gonna have multiple different versions of that, which is why you just look at everything and you look at how many customers you got. You divide it out. You're like, that's our cost per customer.So if we're trying to get unlimited customers, we better be sure we know what our \\[...0.5s\\] costs \\[...0.5s\\] to make sure that we can actually pay for it so that we can get unlimited new customers.Alright, so let's calculate it together. So if you use outreach as your primary way of getting customers, then you use, \\[...0.5s\\] let's say$200 a month in email software, and you pay someone$3,000 a month to do cold email prospecting for you.Then \\[...0.6s\\] emails \\[...0.4s\\] become appointments that turn into eight sales per month. And so then you pay your salesperson$100 for sale. So then what's CAC? Alright, this is like a Chechy PT prompt word problem, but fundamentally this is what it looks like for you as a business owner.So this is how we, this how we calculate so the total cost for 8 sales means that you have a 3,000 dollar emailer plus a 200 dollar software, plus 800 bucks in commissions, which is 8 sales times 100 dollars \\[...0.4s\\] equals 4 grand.Alright, so now we divide that by the number of new customers, which is \\[...0.4s\\]$4,000 divided by eight new customers equals 500 bucks \\[...0.4s\\] per sale. So CAC is$500 in this outreach example.So let's say that you have a content business, so let's do this one. So you have to pay two people on your media team that you pay$5,000 a month each, and they help you make, edit and distribute content across all platforms. Right?So that content then turns into inbound messages and then Optimes in your site, and then those leads turn into 10 new customers and you pay$100 in commission per sale.Alright, so what's CAC? So the reason I'm giving you all those stats is so that you can plug your own stats in and then figure this out for yourself.So if my media payroll is 5 k times two is$10,000 a month there, my commissions is 10, sales 7, 200 is 1,000. So all in I got 10 grand plus 1 grand is eleven thousand dollars. So my cost dual car customer will say is$11,000 divided by 10 customers equals \\[...0.6s\\] 11 dollars. So my tax 11 bucks.Now if some of you are like, wait, I have sales payroll in there too, then added it \\[...1.1s\\] if there's something that you don't have here, cut it out. But fundamentally it's just all the money you spend to get new customers divided by how many customers you got.Cool, and I'll do one quick one on paid ads. So \\[...0.6s\\] you spend$4,000 a month on a media buyer. You spend 20 grand \\[...0.4s\\] in buying ads, the actual media itself, you spend a thousand bucks commissions per sale, so it's probably a higher ticket sale. And you spend$1,000 in software and tracking and following up the leads that come in to get 10 new customers.So what's CAC? So media 4K media spend 20K, software 1K, \\[...0.4s\\] commissions 10 times one, 10,000. So all in, \\[...0.7s\\] you send$35,000 \\[...0.8s\\] divided by 10 customers 30\\. Five hundred dollars per customer is our CAC. That's how this works. By the way, one of the best ways to improve any metric is to start measuring it.So how to improve it? In this whole training, I talk about lots of different things that cover and check off different boxes here. But fundamentally, if you had nothing else and you still need to have a cheat sheet for this, it would be you make better offers.That gets you higher response rates. And if you make better offers, you're also gonna convert a higher percentage people, more people take the next step. Uh, if you have better offers in general, your Cpms are also gonna go down because people like, oh, this is a better offer.Great. Uh, you have cheaper labor. So you won't, \\[...0.5s\\] this is not necessarily related, but you could have cheaper labor as a way to improve CAC. Like if you had if you paid your sales guys less, you paid the opout team less, whatever it is, like that could decrease your CAC. And you could have cheaper software because that is also a cost.But I would say if I had to measure which of these is gonna be the biggest levers, it's gonna be these three.And I would, I rarely go and dip into these ones to be very candid with you because you have such order of magnitude changes you can make up here that sometimes this stuff becomes irrelevant. You lose morale for no real, \\[...0.4s\\] no real benefit all right, so we talk about these two primarily for this book. So the two most powerful words in advertising are free and new \\[...0.7s\\] use them.And so for us, if our objective is to lower Calc to the greatest degree possible, we want to get as many sales as possible for as little advertising dollars as possible.And so that means we want to convert the highest percentage of our audience, and so note that this is expanded content from the book, alright, that I just think is worth knowing. Alright, so in hundred million dollar leads, I talk with the value of giving something away for free.Some people don't wanna do that, but let me explain why. I think it's probably a good idea, especially if you're starting out. Alright, so Dan Arielli again, the none of this is in the book, I had to cut this out, so dinner really Arielli, who's a famous behavioral economics \\[...0.5s\\] psychologist, whatever, some science dude.Alright, so he ran this thing called the Hershey kiss test, and he would give away Hershey kisses for free, or he'd give them away for a penny. \\[...1.1s\\] Wanna guess the difference in take rates on a college campus \\[...1.1s\\] nine times more people took the free Hershey kiss versus the one Pennykiss.And he called this the penny gap nine times more \\[...0.6s\\] for those of you who have this, like, hearing hawing of, like, I don't wanna give stuff away for free, \\[...1.3s\\] okay, \\[...0.6s\\] go, \\[...3.1s\\] I think it dilutes my brand. \\[...2.1s\\]Okay, \\[...1.9s\\] there's a difference between giving products away for free and giving value away for free, \\[...0.9s\\] and you have to understand the difference.And I, I have always subscribed to the chick fil a model of this, which is either it's free or it's full price, never discounted. So if we mess something up, your sandwich and your whole meals on us, but \\[...0.8s\\] otherwise it's premium and it's full price, but it's one or the other, there is no in between.And so if we wanna make, let's say you're b to B, you make content that's free, you make lead magnets that are free, you provide value, make software tools, you give them away for free. These are all things.If it's free versus$1, like, well, you're gonna get shitty customers if you do it, like, \\[...1.1s\\] okay, \\[...1.4s\\] go \\[...1.0s\\] and for everyone who does wanna listen, let's keep going.So we start for free, because if they don't want it, it's because they won \\[...0.6s\\] don't want it. And so that means you just change what you're giving away or how you describe it. So give me the things wrong or how you describe the things wrong.The second reason somebody doesn't want your free thing is because they don't believe you. So it's too good to be true, so I'll give you a story about this. So there was a famous marketer he used to, he used to on the side teach marketing classes.He talked about believability. And so he would always run this test once a year where he'd run an ad that says, give me$100 and I will give you a thousand dollars back. Call this number \\[...0.6s\\] and no one would call. And the main reason was \\[...0.4s\\] no one believed it.It was too good to be true. Now, to be fair, people are \\[...0.8s\\] dumber now. And so maybe it worked out, but when he would run these tests would have to something, you know, we have to write something, \\[...0.7s\\] maybe. But like the point hopefully remains.All right, the next is \\[...1.0s\\] I've seen this split test work more times than I care for.But if you advertise something that can help you make an extra$5,000 a month versus something that helps you make an extra$500 a month, this one gets more optance. And so you're like, how could a lower result get more people to want it? And it's because more people believe it. \\[...1.9s\\]Kind of interesting. The last reason that people don't want your free thing is cause it's the wrong people seeing it.So it's like, if I'm getting a free gym membership that's offered in Ohio, \\[...0.7s\\] I'm never in Ohio, so I don't really care. And so if you're selling, you know, fur coats to, you know, Arizonans in the summer, probably not the right market.Even if it's like, hey, it's free, it's like, I'm just never gonna wear it right now. There's intrinsic value for codes, but you get the idea.Alright, and so big 3 is that I like testing this because if you give stuff away for free, then you know that if people don't want it, you change what it is or how you describe it. They don't believe you can give it to him or you show it to the wrong people.All of these things are great feedback for us. So here are the pros of free is that you will get more leads for free, \\[...0.4s\\] and you will get lower cost leads when you market or advertise with free. Here are the cons of free is that the volume can be a double edged sword if you're not prepared for it.So if you use some of the stuff in this book and this training, you're gonna get way more leads than ever, ever used to. And so what'll happen is you'll get way more people reaching out. If you don't have the man power or the time to reach out to all these leads, it's wasteful. And so what you then do is you can add friction. So you give something away for free and then add friction.And so then you can add qualifications which could be like types of questions, the number of steps in a process. The targeting you do is also another form of friction. You can force them to consume stuff prior to taking another step. You can \\[...0.4s\\] increase ad length.These are all things that you can do to increase friction. Alright, so if you're looking at this and you're like writing this, like these are the steps that you can do to add friction to any advertising process. And so for me, I don't wanna make my ads or my offers worse.I wanna make them better and then add more friction. Because fundamentally the idea is, like, I wanna get as many people who want this thing to raise their hand, and then put my filters in place so that only the people with money who are qualified come through.But I want the strongest magnet to get as many people as possible to take that first step, and then the filter to cut out as many of the people who I don't want in \\[...0.5s\\] that I got as extra eyeballs or extra clicks for my big amazing sexy thing. \\[...1.1s\\]And so the other kind of free is that sometimes you have people have no intention of buying.Right, this is the, \\[...0.4s\\] the free brings broke people myth. Let me see if I actually dive into this deeper. Okay, I don't, so I'll tell you right now. So here's the free brings by broke people myth. \\[...3.4s\\] We tested this, \\[...0.4s\\] so we have a tremendous amount of data on this concept. Um, but in gyms, as you might imagine, cause I came from the gym world. Uh, we'd have gym owner saying I don't wanna give away free service.They'd be like, undervalues my brand, blah, blah, blah, blah whatever okay, \\[...0.8s\\] so what we did was we ran a test, and we said \\[...0.5s\\] 10 locations \\[...0.5s\\] run not free, so we're not gonna use free in the advertising, and then you 10 locations use free in the advertising, everything else stays the same. \\[...1.2s\\]Guess what happened? \\[...2.6s\\] The non free guys \\[...0.6s\\] closed fewer sales \\[...0.4s\\] then the free guys, but here's the real kicker, \\[...0.5s\\] the clothes rate between the non free people and the free people was the same. The best sales guys could close people came in for free, and the best sales guys could close people who came in for not for free.And the shitty sales people couldn't sell anybody who came in for not free, and the shitty sales people couldn't sell anybody who came in for free.So the only thing that changed between these two things was the cost of the lead. And so these guys were paying way less per lead, so they made more sales, but the average close rate was the same.We tested this on 20 locations across different markets, so and, and I had to do this every so often because it would rise up in the community, like, we shouldn't be giving away free stuff, and be like, dude, you can do whatever you want. I like to do math, and so if the math works, do it.If you don't want that, fine, do it your way, \\[...0.8s\\] but don't also want a different outcome. \\[...1.7s\\]So that is the free brings with people, man, is that \\[...0.9s\\] rich people also like free stuff, and if it's what they want, they'll take a first step, because if you'd remove risk for me, I'll take a no risk, I'll take a, I'll take a flyer I'll take a look, \\[...0.6s\\] but then if you make a follow up offer \\[...0.8s\\] foreshadowing, uh, \\[...0.6s\\] I might also buy, \\[...0.4s\\] right.And so the closing percentage, the only difference was the lead cost between this locations. Alright. So the bottom line is that if I had only one offer to make to convert or my family would be killed, \\[...0.7s\\] it would be a free offer.And I'd rather wade through crappy leaves first and then figure out how to add friction rather than look at an empty inbox in an empty calendar waiting for my next client to show up.Think about this for one more moment. One of my big sayings that I've repeated internally in terms of advertising is create flow, \\[...1.2s\\] then monetize, then add friction.So you create flow, which means give the big sexy thing away. The monetizes, make sure that you're getting the right people on so you can sell them now if it's not as efficient as you want.That's the third step. That's the optimization, that's the ad friction. But even inefficiently, we're getting money. Cool. Now we plug the filters in. Now we optimize. So create flow, monetize, add friction.There's a three steps I follow. And so the thing is you can't optimize an empty inbox, you can't optimize an empty calendar, you can't optimize a funnel that gets no clicks. And so you want to start with the flow \\[...0.5s\\] first. \\[...1.2s\\]All right. Next point in terms of how to improve CAC \\[...0.4s\\] is, okay, so discounts in free. So these are more or less the same thing. I'm gonna use these interchangeably throughout the book. Uh. They really just exist on a continuum. And so 100% discount is free, 99% discount is a discount, but fundamentally it's just a continuing that exists on.And so all the constructs I use in this book, if it says free, you can do it for$1. If it says$1, you can do it for$19. It works the same. Alright? Fundamentally \\[...0.6s\\] you get something for less than its worth. And the arbitrage between its value and what you get for it is the reason someone engages.My little, my little tip here is if you have something where it costs a lot of money for you as a business owner for somebody to miss an appointment.So say you're a dentist or a lawyer or, or you're a chiropractor, and it's your time that's being kind of given away and you charge a lot per hour, whatever then you can have, it might be more advantageous for you to do discounts because then you can get a card on file, which then make sure that the people show up.You can charge no show fees, things like that. And so if you have too many, like, you could solve it in two ways. You make it free.You have the first appointment with someone who's an underling whose time doesn't cost as much. And then from there, you book the one with you \\[...0.5s\\] option A \\[...0.4s\\] or option B you charge some little mini discount thing so you can get a card, so you can charge enough show to make sure people shop. Both work. \\[...1.4s\\]Alright, so here's how I use discounts. I don't, I think the idea of a moderate discount is stupid. So the idea like 10% off or 20% off, I think is dumb. I want insane discounts because 10% off doesn't \\[...0.4s\\] get someone who would otherwise not opt into now opt it.It doesn't change behavior, and so \\[...0.4s\\] the only purpose of freer discount is to change behavior, is to get people who would not have taken an action to then take an action as a result of the freer discount or the arbitrage of value.All right, \\[...0.4s\\] and so for me, if I'm gonna do discounts, I want 50% or higher for something that people already know the value of for it to be effective. Now \\[...0.6s\\] the objective here is to get people who would otherwise respond to do so.Alright, and if you're not giving away 20% off the top for the same number of people, cause that just means you just lose money.The same number of people reply at 10 or 20% off, you just losing a ton of profit. And so don't worry, I will show you how to do it without giving out away the farm. Alright, like, you're like, wait, how am I gonna do with it? Relax, that's what this whole thing is about. Alright, so there's four ways to display discounts.Number one is that you can say \\[...0.5s\\] the percentage off. Alright, so let's say it's 87% off the first visit. Alright, that would be, let's say it's a, it's 13 bucks for my hundred dollar first visit. It would be 87% off. Okay, fine. The next way would be the absolute amount off, so be$87 off.Now the example here, it's hundred$81 off the first week, normally 2\\. 10, fine, that would be 87%.All right, but it's a different way of displaying it. You're like, why is he telling me this? Because you test these. So if you have your hundred dollar thing, you run 87% off, you run $87 off you then run the relative equivalent off, meaning what is that \\[...0.4s\\] savings of value worth.All right, so like save a steak dinner, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, or less than going out to lunch. It's saying this.You wanna, you wanna frame it now a different way of thinking about this is called a portion off, which, um, I usually bucket into this, which be like, if I had, let's say a hundred dollar a month subscription.Uh, and the thing was 12 months at 12 dollars, if I, \\[...0.7s\\] if I wanna give 25% off again, we're breaking rules here, but, uh, if I wanna give 25% off, which would be three months, \\[...0.4s\\] four months off, \\[...0.4s\\] uh then that would mean that I could say, okay, this is$800. I could say it's four months free. I could say it's 25% off.I could say that you get$400 off. Those are all different ways of describing the exact same thing. I could also say, finally, it's$800 and above that, I would have 12 dollars crossed off, which is simply displaying the discounted price next to the retail value. These are all different ways that you can display a discount.And since this book is about monetizing traffic, you need to know the different guns you've got, the different weapons, you've got, the bullets in the chamber that you can use as an advertiser to rotate through \\[...0.5s\\] to get one more people to respond, but also to keep the advertising fresh.So like if one month you run four months free and then next month you run$400 off, and then next month you run$800 crossed off 12, the market feels like you're changing your offer every month, but that way internally for you, everything is the exact same, but it creates freshness in terms of the advertising.So how different do all those feel? They are all the same thing, just presented different ways. And that's why we do this.So this is a little pro tip that I will give you. You probably can't read this. I'll just tell you what it says. Um, which is that in order for \\[...0.5s\\] a \\[...0.4s\\] price off \\[...0.5s\\] or \\[...0.4s\\] a \\[...0.7s\\] simply discounted price to work, the market has to have an understanding of what the price of that commodity or what that service is.And so if I say that I'm, I'm selling, you know, an adjustment for a chiropractor for$29 that is effective because people know it cost more than that. They might not know how much more, but they just know that it's more, that's cheap for that thing.If I say twenty dollar teeth whitening at a dentist, that's gonna get a lot of people who are superincenter, cause people know it's way more than 20 dollars.I'd probably say hundred dollar teeth whitening, and people would still say that's a great deal, right, because there's an idea \\[...0.4s\\] now. If you have an intangral product or a \\[...0.6s\\] product that no one else sells, or it's a digital product, or you're like a creator, and you wanna launch something.If you then say it's this price \\[...0.4s\\] off of this price there's not a lot of value because the, the arbitrages is arbitrary, \\[...0.7s\\] so you made it up, \\[...0.6s\\] and so there's no, there's no paid kind of marketplace price for the thing that you're selling.And so in those instances, that's where percentages off of retail things like that work a little bit better than just saying, like, \\[...1.1s\\] seventeen dollar, \\[...0.4s\\] you know, course.It's like, well that, that might be expensive for some people and cheap for other people, but for a teeth whitening thing, everyone knows it's cheap. And that's why if you are gonna put that one price on there, you wanna do it.This is, like, me differentiating for what business owner this works for to be clear. Alright, \\[...0.5s\\] so here are the pros of discounts, so we talked about the pros of free stuff.Here are the pros of discounts, so, uh, one is that they're compliant for cheap leads, meaning you don't have to ever worry about, like, anybody saying that you did a bait and switch or anything like that. So if you charge people for stuff, then there's, there's really nothing to say about it.Alright, number two is that you can actually collect some money, which is decent, right, I mean, some money is better than no money. Okay, um, people do come expecting to spend some money.So this to be fair, this is my belief on this. I believe that the reason that the discounted people come in and buy more is because sales people believe that. I don't believe it actually has any difference. Because when we talked about the free versus not free, the clothes rates were the same.So I think it's more that sales people feel more convicted. But when I look at the data, it doesn't make much of a difference because I could equally say these people were just looking for cheap stuff, \\[...0.5s\\] works the same way. It just depends on what narrative you wanna tell the salesperson. Um, these work, and this is probably the most important one. These work exceptionally well as two step sales.Here's why \\[...0.6s\\] if you get someone's card before they come in, then when you, when they come in you can then make the upsell and say, do you wanna use the card you have in file?And so the key is that you have the card more than what you charge them for. So, it's like, you almost wanna charge them for the cheapest possible thing to make sure the card works, so that when they come in, you can have a seamless upsell into the really expensive thing. And so that's what creates the upsells that are smooth as butter point five.Now here's the concept discounts. If you don't do it right, you're giving away, you don't ever give away the core service at a discount, you give away a break broken off piece of the core service or something extra that you create, and then create a huge discount on it.Alright, and so you don't give away core offers that has, or stuff that has hard cost unless you like, really know what you're doing. Um, you splinter out the thing.Now I talk about this at length in the hundred million Dollar offers course. I'm not gonna break it down now, but basically lots of different components to your offer, you have lots of different features. You take one feature off, you say this feature is 99% off now. Great, that's where the discount is, and then you sell the rest of it.Alright, and so \\[...0.7s\\] whatever you break off, it has to be something that's well understood or it's not gonna work. Alright, that's kind of thing I was talking about earlier, people have to have an understanding of it. Um, the cons are you got the bargain hoppers, right?People who, you know, complain about this, but really they, they're already, you know, uh they're already customers they're easier to upsell though than somebody's cold.So, \\[...0.5s\\] yeah, \\[...0.6s\\] alright, so the objective is that attraction offers \\[...0.4s\\] are the first step in the four prongs because \\[...0.8s\\] if you don't have interest, you don't have anything, \\[...0.4s\\] right.And so customer finance acquisition requires demand and a big difference between CAC and GP, having low cost or free front ends is a strong way to do it. So lots of demand, free big front ends drives more in. \\[...1.2s\\]Alright, so these things are going to be interchangeable throughout the remainder of these trainings. So if you see 19 dollar chiropractor visit, it can be just as much a free chiropractor visit. The whole thing will work. But if you're, like, you insist on doing this fine, do that.If you insist on doing this, \\[...0.4s\\] fine, do that. It does not matter all the money models that I will show. You can have free or discount interchange. And they will both work \\[...1.9s\\] Kaboom. These are the ways that you can prove your CAC. So with that being said, \\[...0.4s\\] CAC is covered. Now we go into gross profit.  \n\\[...2.0s\\]So we just triangulated the kashuquire customer's \\[...0.6s\\] gross profit and payback period, that is what creates \\[...0.7s\\] client finest acquisition, and I wanna unleash the three levels advertising, this is also not in the book for you, alright, so client finest acquisition or CFA, the three levels advertising, so this is how I would describe three levels advertising for you as a business owner.So let's start with level 1, this is where lifetime gross profit is greater than the costal car customer. This is the da level, alright, so you gotta make more money than it cost you to make it over the lifespan of the customer, ideally at least 3 times more.So what it cost you to make money, how much money you make \\[...1.0s\\] fundamentally, that's it. If you don't have that, then you don't have a business, so you need at least this to be a business that can make money and grow.So level 2 is 30 day gross profit, not lifetime notice, the big difference here is the time difference, this is forever, and this is the first month, \\[...0.5s\\] right, is greater than CAC.I'll explain why the first month is so important in a second. All right. So \\[...0.4s\\] we want to make more money than it costs you to make it in 30 days. And so the result, this is the key part, is that you never spend your own money to grow.And so why is 30, why is 30 days the number? Because that's the amount of time that any business can borrow money with zero interest in the form of a credit card or credit lines.Many businesses, banks would even give you \\[...0.4s\\] interest free credit lines for 30, sometimes 60, sometimes 90 days depending on, \\[...0.5s\\] you know, your relationship with the bank, how much money it is, whatever, but at least every business can get 30 day interest free money. \\[...1.1s\\]And so that means that \\[...0.8s\\] the way the financial system exists right now, at least in America, \\[...0.7s\\] you can get money \\[...0.9s\\] and not pay for it as long as you pay it back in a month.Which means that my objective for you, because I've always operated on, I've owned everything and I haven't sold equity and I haven't taken on debt \\[...0.8s\\] to grow all my businesses, and I've been able to grow them absurdly fast relative to the marketplace. I'll just say it like that.And the way that we middle do it is because I take the money that I have access to and I could take as much as I possibly can, as long as I figure out a way to pay it back in that first month. \\[...1.1s\\]Alright, and so you can use the credit card \\[...0.4s\\] to get your customers, then pay the card back, then reuse the money, recycle the cash and get another customer.Alright, as long as your gross profit in the first 30 days is greater than the cost to get them, you can never carry debt while growing your business, which is a sizable advantage.So \\[...0.6s\\] this is what level 2 advertising will look like. So 30 days gross profit. So that means that, like, if I got that first customer, right, if it cost me, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, one 60 to get the customer, and I got one 80 back in gross profit, then it's just all free. \\[...1.7s\\] They're all, it's just all free. That's how it works.And so note is that if you have an x x x limit on your credit card, you'll always be limited by the amount of customers that x x x number buys you before having to pay it back.And so this assumes that you don't reinvest the excess profits after the 30 days on marketing rather than putting it in your pocket.Okay, so \\[...0.6s\\] once you unlock acquisition this way, typically \\[...0.8s\\] you will get limited by your operational constraints \\[...0.4s\\] before you will get limited \\[...0.4s\\] by your advertising constraints.You will not be able to handle the amount of customers that you can bring in, and that's what's going to throttle down your advertising more than you can't get more customers.So that's level 2 is that now your 30 day gross profit is greater than your hack, which means you're just getting free customers. Now \\[...0.6s\\] level 3 is where I like to live, which is that my 30 day gross profit is greater than two times the cost of getting a customer.Okay, so pay attention what happens here. So you make gross profit more than twice CAC in the first 30 days, and the result is never being limited by money at all.Remember the first version, this is like, I'm limited by the amount of credit card that I can have access to. With this, \\[...0.4s\\] there are no limits, \\[...1.2s\\] and this is the goal of everything that I'm gonna basically go through, through the rest of this training with you.Alright, and so this way, one customer pays you back for the debt you have, but then also pays for the next customer.So you basically just repay your original spend one time, and then you have enough money to buy another customer, and then that customer comes again with two customers preloaded into it, and so that you pay itself back, and then the next one, and then that is how you continue to multiply.And now you're using house money \\[...0.7s\\] to use a gambling term, it's like, you're not, you've already repaid yourself back on the first one, but you still have this extra cash you buy, the next day he comes with two and now you're just doubling.And the thing is, is you're doubling your rate of acquisition by customer, not by month, \\[...0.7s\\] which means this can happen daily \\[...0.4s\\] in terms of the doubling, \\[...0.7s\\] alright, and this is the key to unlimited scale for advertising.You have to compound your advertising, \\[...1.5s\\] and so this is what it would look like if you just reinvested on a 30 day loop instead of a daily loop.This is to say like you bought, you know, you get them in today and you have two or three up sales, whatever it is within 30 days, and you get, you get twice the cash back in that, in that 30 day peer.Well, I got one customer this month using that cash and \\[...0.6s\\] next month I've got two, next month, uh, four, next month, \\[...0.5s\\] eight or whatever it is.Yeah, I think that's eight, yes, eight. The next one, 16 would be, you know, all the way up there, alright, more than I can visually display. \\[...1.1s\\] And so this is what it actually looks like math wise.Alright, so actually I think I removed this from the book too. But, uh, within a year of reinvesting your advertising route, this is key poise.If you have to reinvest the advertising profits to getting new customers, the advertising is obviously no longer a bottleneck in your business. And this is what this book accomplishes, removing money as a limit for your growth.And so that's why I like, I write this because for every person, it's like, I need money. To make money, \\[...6.1s\\] you need to have more skills. Somebody who has fewer skills needs more money. \\[...1.5s\\]So look at the math here. \\[...1.3s\\] Month 1 to month 12, \\[...1.1s\\] 1 customer 2 customers 4, 8, 12\\. This is just a 2, \\[...0.6s\\] 2 months white out. And then this is, here's where it gets wild. This is new customers per month. This is total customers.So I'm ending the year with 4,000 customers. If you just make twice what it cost you to acquire customer in gross profit in the first 30 days, and you reinvested all of that into getting more customers, \\[...0.4s\\] and so you can end the year at 4000+ existing customers with that framework.By the way, this is exactly what we're doing with school.com \\[...1.5s\\] is how we're going crazy growth right now. So \\[...0.5s\\] make gross profit more than twice calculators in 30 days.This is where we wanna go and to be clear to achieve this level advertising \\[...0.6s\\] 2 x is the minimum you can by all means get 3 x, 5 x, 10 x, you get 10 customers loaded with every customer, the money just multiplies faster.All right, and so \\[...0.6s\\] I'll tell you this brief story, but if you wanna know what my return was for Jim, watch in the first year, I had a 100 to 1 return in advertising, \\[...0.7s\\] yes, a hundred times.And so I spent a hundred grand and made 10 million. \\[...1.7s\\] The limit to that business then end now was market size and our operational capacity to scale service, not our ability to profitably acquire customers. And that's what I want for you, and that's what this book accomplishes.And that's what I've had in virtually every business \\[...0.4s\\] since my first gyms. And the thing is that I think most people move on from this part too soon. Rather than saying, like, no, we have to make it better until we can get this thing to work for free, \\[...0.7s\\] then you move on. \\[...1.6s\\] And the main reason was we had a better money model \\[...1.6s\\] level 3 check. So \\[...0.5s\\] you were here for the money models training.We just finished the three levels of advertising. Now we do in to talk about money models. \\[...1.7s\\] We talk about the three things for acquisition. So we've got \\[...0.7s\\] cost you a car customer, how much it costs us, gross profit, what we make for, what it costs us. And now we go to payback period, which is how fast this all happens.So if you see PPD, just payback period or payback period I'll probably say it out loud, cause I don't \\[...0.5s\\] Wanna confuse you. Alright, so we got the definition, why it's important examples, and then how to improve it.Let's start our definition, so payback period, how long it takes until gross profit is greater than CAC? \\[...1.6s\\] In other words, how long does it take to break even? The shorter it is, the easier it is to scale your advertising.So if I break even in a day versus breaking even in 5 years, it's a lot easier for me to scam, \\[...0.4s\\] right, cause I got my dollar back tomorrow, then I can spend it again. Some people call this a cash conversion cycle. I probably won't say that again, but just in case you hear it, that's what that means.Alright, so that's the definition, here's \\[...0.4s\\] the importance. Alright, so problem No. 1, businesses take too long to break even on getting new customers, and so they have to manage cash flow by making a marketing budget. I think this is silly. We solve that problem.Problem No. 2 is that businesses feel guilty making multiple offers in a row because they think that they bother people.They are wrong. The people who feel this way are poorer than they should be. And that's exactly how buyers buy, by the way, is that there's short windows, a time that they go super hyper buying cycle and then they go Dorman again.And so if you do not take advantage of this hyper buying cycle when someone makes a new decision or starts a new lifestyle or make creates a new identity for themselves, you will miss out. And another business who is intelligent who makes more money than you will profit. \\[...1.2s\\]So \\[...0.9s\\] here's a story you probably haven't heard from it. So, uh, \\[...0.5s\\] friend of mine \\[...0.4s\\] business owner decides to lose weight \\[...0.6s\\] and, uh, remembers that they like riding bikes and goes online to buy a bike.Alright, \\[...0.6s\\] now this is what happens. After she immediately buys a bike, \\[...0.8s\\] she enters a hyperactive buying mode. She then buys a helmet, she buys shoes, she buys pants, she buys gloves, she buys water bottle, she buys, she signs it for a race.You get the idea all within a day or two. Now if you were that first bike shop owner and you were like, well, I don't wanna offer a helmet, I don't wanna offer shoes, I don't offer, I don't wanna seem pushy, \\[...0.6s\\] she wants to buy them, she signed up for a race, she's going she's going to buy them. It's just whether she's gonna buy it from you or the guy down the street.And there's a very big difference between hard selling and letting a customer know the offers you have available. You're making offers available to them.And if you have think about it this way, if someone has a problem and you have the ability to solve it, it's my opinion that ethically, you should let them know you can solve it and what it would cost them for you to do it for them.You make them aware. If they say no, no problem, fine, \\[...0.7s\\] but at least tell them make the offer, \\[...0.4s\\] because \\[...0.8s\\] you sell 0% of people who don't know you have something to sell. \\[...1.4s\\] You are making offers. They can choose to take them or not, and if you believe in what you solve, solves a problem, then solve more problems. Yes, it's cool, no also knock also not cool, yes, also cool.All right, so that's the important, so let's do a quick example, so payback periods, so if it cost you$160 to acquire customer CAC, \\[...0.4s\\] and you sell, would you for$100 a month?That cost you 20 bucks gross profit, so$80, what's your payback period? We make$100 \\[...0.8s\\] from the, the person who buys their first month.Our gross profits 80, cause we have to have 20 bucks that are off for cost of goods. So that means that I spent one 60, but I made 100 back, but I had another cost of 20 for my cost of goods, so I have 80 dollars left over, \\[...0.4s\\] sorry, let, uh, I'm down 80 month one.Alright, so let's look at month two month two I didn't have my cost require the customer. I still have my cost to deliver. I make my hundred minus my 20 cost to deliver. I have another 80, so now I'm at zero. Okay, so month two is my break even month. So what's my payback period?Two months \\[...0.8s\\] also to be really clear here. If it cost you 160 bucks to a car customer, some people are like, it takes me one and a half months \\[...0.4s\\] to break even here, because they see$100 in revenue. They say, oh, it's one and a half months, \\[...0.4s\\] you have to take out your cost of goods in the payback period. If it cost me$9 and meals, and I sell 10 bucks for the meal, I make a dollar.I can't say, oh, you know they paid me 20 bucks, it cost me 20, I break even in two months, you have to do off gross profit.Alright, so here's how to improve it. You can make them more better or new offers, and here's the key part in the first 30 days, \\[...0.4s\\] and the key part is to do it at the right moment. The reason that somebody will not take an Upsoft from you is cause you did it the wrong way or at the wrong time.We described it poorly or the wrong person, right. And so let me give you the supplement sale example. This is just a zone in on timing presenting it at the right time. So I say this because some of you might have an amazing upsolve offer. You just you're just presenting it not when the problem, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, exists, \\[...0.5s\\] all right, or creates itself.So I tried to sell supplements \\[...0.7s\\] after people bought services from me, and it didn't work.Now I could give you a whole bunch of theories around that someone comes in saying they wanna lose weight, and I say awesome, let's get you signed up. And then right then after they signed up, I say, oh, by the way, by these supplements, they might think, wait, isn't that a hyper buying cycle?It's my belief that the person scratched their itch of weight loss the moment I sold them the service package. And now I'm like trying to reopen a closed wound.Kind of it's like wait, I thought I just solved that problem, right. So what I figured out was \\[...0.7s\\] I would say, hey, come in for \\[...0.4s\\] nutrition orientation, and then 48 hours later they come in for nutrition orientations, and then I walk through their food, \\[...0.7s\\] and so with the food, then I would say, oh, you're not eating these things.You should probably add this stuff in. I created a new problem which I could then solve with supplements. And so the thing is that you wanna be able to offer it at the right time.You sell at the point of greatest deprivation, not at the point of greatest satisfaction \\[...0.7s\\] or really like \\[...1.5s\\] advanced people know what I just said. Beginners, please hear that again, \\[...0.4s\\] you sell at the point of greatest deprivation, at the point of greatest pain, \\[...0.4s\\] not at the point of greatest satisfaction.If I just had a big steak dinner, \\[...0.6s\\] and then you say, do you want another steak? You might have amazing steak, I don't need any more steak, I'm satisfied.And a lot of you guys are trying to make your up, so offer after I already ate a steak, \\[...0.7s\\] now I might have a dessert stomach that's open, \\[...0.6s\\] but my steak stomach is full, \\[...0.5s\\] so we create deprivation. We make offers at the moment of deprivation.If somebody's really thirsty in the desert \\[...0.4s\\] after you give them the cup of water, they don't want the second cup as much as they wanted the first one.So the timing matters, \\[...0.4s\\] so these are the times that I think through when I tend to incorporate up cells, and this is important for decreasing payback period, so one is right immediately after the first sale. Sometimes this works great, so to be clear if I'm selling.If, if that new if I solved one problem, that then naturally creates the next problem immediately.Upselling works \\[...0.7s\\] if you have to create another kind of problem in someone's head or \\[...0.6s\\] guide them through awareness, then that's where you have what I call the next step, so the version I just gave you with the orientation the nutrition orientation that's, like, great. That's the next step in the process. So this is usually a 24, 48, 72 hour difference between first sale \\[...0.5s\\] and next step.The next time period where I think about selling a customer upselling is after they have a big win. This is a milestone. Someone says, you know they have some big success now you're like, wait, I thought you said that you sell the point of greatest deprivation.Yes. So if they have a big success then it means we fully solved one problem, which typically means a fully formed new problem also opened. So great, you got to$10,000 a month.You probably have all these tax problems now. You probably need employees to help you take all this time because now that you're working all the time and you're making this money, you probably don't have time.You have money but not time. So let me solve the next problem for you, right? And so you can. Oh, there's always if you're a good entrepreneur, you're always solving problems and fully solve problems always create more problems. \\[...1.3s\\]After they have a big win, then I like to think about the halfway point. This is just me historically seeing that people at a halfway point tend to be very open to upseling, and finally, I call this the last chance.Now if you're like, wait a second, at the end of a of a period of the customer is the last chance, not when I should up sell. Yeah, \\[...0.6s\\] if you haven't upsold them here, \\[...0.6s\\] so many of you guys are trying to make your upsell at the end of the first day.You've already lost, \\[...0.8s\\] like, this is your last shot, you missed all of the other times that you're supposed to sell them, and notice 4 out of the 5 or before the halfway point, \\[...1.4s\\] so you're losing out.So I can almost guarantee, \\[...0.9s\\] well, say this way, I have never not had this work, so I can't guarantee it, but I've never not had it work, which is if this is when you're upselling people or attempting upselling, cause I already know you're probably failing at it, \\[...0.7s\\] if you move it forward \\[...0.4s\\] in the sales process.In my opinion, you have an incomplete buying cycle, so I don't wanna reopen something.I wanna just ride the one I'm already on. It's like hey, you're halfway through, let's keep the party going. Hey, you're doing great. Let's, let's keep it going, let's, let's add this other piece of service on, hey, let's, let's get you there faster, \\[...0.4s\\] right? Let's, let's decrease your risk on this.Let me get you more support, whatever it is, \\[...0.6s\\] right, we wanna keep the party going. I don't wanna finish my service package and then have to be like, okay, now that you've completed our first, you know service of work.Let's talk about working together again. It's like, uh I'm good with what you gave me before, you know I'm pretty happy with that, this is cool.All right, so there's the five times I think about selling \\[...1.0s\\] now \\[...0.7s\\] again, make more better new offers the first 30 days. These are the five, so \\[...0.5s\\] immediately in the same conversation or conversion event. Next step is 24 to 72 hours.First big win. This means you focus on getting them fast win so that you then create any problems that you can then solve halfway point. Um, this is just I just I'm telling you just it just has worked, so I'll just throw it out there. I give you some scientific whatever thing, but I just know it works.And then last chance is the exit interview, right, and this is only useful for payback periods if it's within the first 30 days, but pretty much all of these ones \\[...1.1s\\] apply most of the times within the first 30 days the customer come in.These are some easy ways to do this. You can have somebody pay first in last month today, or you can add an initiation fee, an onboarding fee, an enrollment fee, an activation fee, or make up whatever fee you want.You two can have this power. Uh, you just you just add that on. So if I wanted to improve that when I had earlier, if I didn't wanna wait two months, I would say great, we pay first and last, that's how we've always done it. And then I could offset now notice the fee is all gross profit.So now I'm actually up 80 on my first transaction, and now I've got half the cost to get a new customer already back in my pocket before I even have the next payment 30 days later. So every two customers buys me another one \\[...0.9s\\] before even having a way for the recurring to hit.Alright, and this is how you really scale. This is just one structure, there's a gazillion that I'm gonna show you. Alright, so we went from two months to one and a half, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, within 30 days. Alright, so that's how you improve it, \\[...0.8s\\] and that is about shortening payback period, \\[...0.5s\\] making money faster. \\[...2.7s\\] Gross profit. All right, let's rock in.So this is the second of the three metrics that we look at to trianclet acquisition. We started with CAC, you have to have cheap customers. We talk about different ways to improve it for your discount, different ways to display discounts. Uh, but now we're gonna talk about gross profit.Okay, so we're gonna find what it is, why it's important examples calculating and improving it. Alright, let's rock, so gross profit, the difference between the price \\[...0.6s\\] and the cost of goods sold. So cost of goods or cogs is what it cost you to deliver the thing.Alright, so it cost me$9 to deliver meals, and I sell it for 10, and I got$1 in rush profit. Alright, very straightforward. Now here's why this is important. So the problem is that most businesses think they need cheaper leads when in reality they need to make more money per customer.And so my observation is that the CAC, this is this is me, like, high level, cause I see lots of businesses. CAC between competitors is often fairly similar. So a lot of people are, you know obsessing about how they're like, you know they wanna improve their ads and things like that.Sometimes you do need to do that, but \\[...0.4s\\] the ranges are actually much tighter than you think. So you might see somebody who's, you know acquiring customers at twenty five hundred dollars somebody and somebody else in the marketplace might be 30, five hundred dollars.Rarely would you see somebody like$6,000 unless they're like just getting into the market. But the CAC for specific avatars is usually pretty tight in terms of ranges. When I see many businesses in the same industry, now that may surprise you, but that just like kind of is what it is.But the difference between how much money these companies make is often how much customers are worth. Now that is where the huge discrepancy between businesses exists. So \\[...1.2s\\] this is the difference between the whales and the minnows is how much they make per customer gross profit.All right, so \\[...0.4s\\] let me tell you a quick story. So I did a consulting day years and years, years ago, might have been the first five ever done my whole life. Um, and a guy was in the same space as me and you're like, wait, Alex, why would you help somebody who's a, quote, competitor? I don't see the world that way.So guy came in and he was selling the same number of units per month as me all right, same number of units per month as me but I was making 56 times more profit than he was. That means 56 years of him making.The amount of money that he made is what I made every year. And so he was making$300,000 a year in profit, and I was making 17 million a year in profit. Same number of units sold \\[...0.5s\\] per month, and so the major difference is how much we made per customer.And so gross profit is the arms race of business, \\[...0.5s\\] because the thing is, is the person who makes the most money can spend the most money. \\[...1.3s\\]This is how you get an ethical monopoly. So, like, \\[...0.4s\\] you don't have a monopoly from, okay, I'm a, I'm you know, I'm somehow protecting any, like no one else can do business.You're saying you're welcome to do business, \\[...0.4s\\] but I'm gonna outspend you on all advertising channels so for you to get your word out, you're gonna have to outbid me, but because I created a better business model, I can outspend you \\[...0.6s\\] in the auction of attention.This is Dan Quentinity quote. He who can spend the most to acquire customer wins. This is my version of the quote which is what I, of course I like my version, uh, he who makes his customer worth more to his business than do his competition wins. I think about this in terms of what can I do.So rather than thinking, oh, I can spend, I loved it to be very clear. Um, you can spend the most. It's like, it's what do I do in order to spend the most, what I do is I make my customer more valuable. The outcome of that input is that I can now spend more. So these are really just two parts of the same quote.If this is the precursor to this one, if that makes sense. Alright, so that's why this is important. So I'll give you an example. \\[...1.5s\\]So I remember when I, uh, \\[...0.6s\\] I was, uh, at, at Smoothie King, I was a blender tender, and my buddy was reading this article in the back of the store, probably goofing off when we probably shouldn't have been. Uh, and he was like, dude, check this out, this guy bought a 50,000 dollar burger.And we looked at it, it was like made of gold and whatever crazy Wall Street person bought a 50,000 burger, right? And, \\[...0.7s\\] and I was thinking about that.And I remember the article says something like he was making \\[...0.4s\\]$50 million a year, something like that in income. And so what I ended up doing \\[...0.6s\\] was I started looking at \\[...0.4s\\] what it cost him in hours versus what it cost me in hours for the burger that I bought \\[...0.5s\\] earlier that day.And so then I realized that my 13 dollar burger \\[...0.5s\\] was the same to me as this Wall Street guys 50,000 dollar burger. That it was actually the same level of inconsequential cost \\[...0.5s\\] for him as it was for me. And arguably this was more expensive for me than it was for him. Just a normal burger.And so that, that concept \\[...0.5s\\] basically is the reverse of the realization that \\[...1.1s\\] you can only go down to zero. You can go infinitely high when it comes to lifetime value.And so, like, you can only drive down so far right on to on the, on the car side but in terms of how much you can make, that's where you can be as creative as you want in terms to continue to increase the lifetime growth profit per customer.And so it can make something as insane as paying$50,000 for a burger or CAC \\[...0.5s\\] actually still be relatively cheap for you if you know how to increase the value of the customer. And so think of the burgers as the commodity, which is traffic.Think of our income as the lifetime gross profit. If I were competing with this guy, he would be able to outspend me 30\\. 7 hundred times over, and in the auction of attention, he would outbid me every time. And our goal is to do the same to our competitors.Alright, so you need to look at both sides getting customers for last, but also making them worth more.Alright, and before we improve it, we gotta know how to calculate it. So \\[...0.4s\\] here's gross profit how we calculate. So here's a product example, so if I sell a widget for$100, it cost me 20 bucks to manufacture it and ship the widget to the end customer.Alright, so my gross profit is 100, where it's 100 \\[...0.4s\\]- 20\\. 80 bucks, this was left over. This is my gross profit.Okay, here's a service example, let's say I deliver services monthly and I have one account representative per 10 customers. If my clients pay me$3,000 per month each, and my reps cost me$6,000 per month, we can then figure out the gross profit market.Okay, so the rep salary$6,000, the clients per rep is 10, \\[...0.5s\\] the cost per client means it's$600 per client. Remember, we make$6,000 \\[...0.4s\\] divided by 10 clients$600 per client. Gross profit, all right, is now$3,000. What they pay us \\[...0.4s\\] minus my cost per client, which means 24 dollars left over.The reason I'm going through this is that many of you guys watching this are service based businesses and don't know your costs. These are your costs, \\[...0.8s\\] so my gross margins are 24 divided by$3,000, which is 80%. \\[...1.4s\\]Rule of thumb from Alex, if you run a service based business, \\[...0.9s\\] local brick and mortar or national, you want at least an 80% gross profit margin. Now they, that may sound crazy to you, but it is very unlikely that you will scale in service unless you have 80 or higher. So not just that means that if it cost you 100, you gotta sell it for 500.Now you might think, cause if you're a newer business owner, you're like, no, that, that seems unreasonable. \\[...1.3s\\] That's your gross profit, not your net profit.You still have rent, you've got, you've got your fixed admin cost you've got insurance, you've got utilities, you've got brake fix that happens within your business, you've got all these other costs that go into doing business. You're not running 80% net margins.You're just saying this is now all the money I have left over to run the rent, I still gotta spend advertising dollars, like, there's all this money that I still gotta spend. And so if you're, if you're at 80 you might be running a 30% \\[...0.4s\\] net margin business.Right, so just to give you context on this, okay, \\[...0.7s\\] and so \\[...0.8s\\] the pro tip is that gross margin equals gross profit times 100%. So if you ever hear me say gross profit versus gross margin, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, it's just, this is a percentage, this is an absolute, that's all it is.So gross profits, the absolute, \\[...0.5s\\] uh, gross margin is the percentage, that's all is.Okay, so if I say it's 80 bucks in gross profit, it's 80% gross margins. I just, I, I clarify this because if you've ever, like, read stuff, and, like, wait a second, is this different? It's just a different way of measuring the same thing.That's all it is, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, cool, \\[...0.9s\\] so \\[...1.0s\\] big picture, \\[...0.6s\\] this is what the business was. Uh, this is the example I gave visually, this is the correct visual, uh, \\[...0.7s\\] all right, and you can note that gross profit is not net profit, all right, this is \\[...0.7s\\] the cost limited to the, that with a business encourage directly from delivering the thing.So if you had an administrative assistant, and you sell cups for$10, that cost you$2, we wouldn't factor in your administrative assistant into the$8 or gross profit.It's off the gross profit that we eventually pay for everything else in the business to create our net profit aka what's left over at the end of the month.Alright, so your rent doesn't go into your gross profit, your admin cost don't go into your gross profit, your utilities don't go into your gross profit. It's just the cost of, okay, if I sold another one of these, if I sold another customer, what are the variable costs?What are the costs that go up per unit sold? If your rent doesn't go up per unit sold, if your admin cost doesn't go up per unit sold, then it is not factored into gross profit. But if my hard cost of cups, if I sell another cup, I still have to incur that cost.If I, if I have a if I have to sell another client then a certain portion of my resources of client delivery is gonna get allocated to that next client. Now some people like wait, but I have to pay my person \\[...0.4s\\] either way. Not really, I mean, you do up to 20 and then you have to hire another one.And so you just have to fractionalize it in terms of your thinking. They may feel fixed, but it's not, you just have to, you have chunkier um start stops more than it's \\[...0.6s\\] a fixed cost that makes sense \\[...0.4s\\] when it comes to calculating this. \\[...1.0s\\]So you're like, okay, got it. I have mine and mine sucks, so what I do to improve it? So improving gross profit, there's a lot of ways \\[...0.4s\\] to increase gross profits, um, but without altering price or cost structure.The three easiest to remember are more betternote, alright, which is sell more of the stuff. So more quantity or duration of the thing, so get them to buy in bulk or buy again tomorrow.Sell a better quality version of the thing, so that would be like a regular burger versus an organic burger, or a large group versus personal training better version of the thing, or sell a new thing. So you fries and a Coke, which then you can supersize on quality Equality as top, on top of that.That's the that's the quick and dirty. We're gonna get into lots of different versions of this, all right, so that is gross profit"

    "content": "\\[...2.2s\\]Alright, so we covered how business make money, the three prongs of client finance acquisition, the three levels of advertising that create the best version of CFA, how money models work, the four types of offers. Now we begin our ride along apprenticeship. Alright, so we transition to the ride along.Simple skills are easy to teach. Some skills are complex skills that have many skills bundled within them that take longer \\[...0.4s\\] to get a big enough sample size to be proficient.So for example, if you're looking at deals, it takes a very long time to see lots of different deals to be able to recognize patterns, takes a long time to look at lots of different surgical cases of different patients to be able to recognize patterns.And so it's more that the larger meta skill of pattern recognition takes a longer time to learn. And that's typically why people work with an expert for periods of time in order to get that skillset. Alright, and so advertising and greeting money models are some of those harder skills.In my opinion, it takes time to see those patterns and to know what to look for. And the better you get, the better the student you are. And so there's three steps to teaching as I see it, document, demonstrate, duplicate.I cover this in my leans book, and so a good teacher make sure that you do all three of these things. You document, you demonstrate, they duplicate, right, they being well, flip this. I, I document, I demonstrate, you duplicate.Okay, now the problem with me training like this one too many is that I can't see \\[...0.8s\\] you do it, right.So I can only do the first two, \\[...0.4s\\] right. It'll be up to you to duplicate this, but I will teach you exactly how I Learned all these money models so that you can get my first decade of experience \\[...0.4s\\] in a day and shortcut your path to your goals.Alright, so it's me taking, you know, 10 or now 13 years \\[...0.5s\\] or 14, whatever, \\[...0.4s\\] um, and compressing it into a full day. And I'm gonna tell you the stories, how I Learned them so that hopefully you can kind of relive to the best \\[...0.9s\\] way possible as though you were with me. Alright?And the reason I felt compared to share these money models is I made a very tactical video with three money models two years ago. In the amount of messages that I got from people being like, I made 50 grand from that video, I made 100 grand.I made a million dollars on that video. I was like, oh, people get the offer, \\[...0.4s\\] they get the lead stuff, but they're not, they don't understand how to put the money, how to connect that with them making a profit and then being able to scale their advertising through sequencing offers together.That was the thing that I didn't know that people weren't putting together. And I was like, oh, and then that is why I make these. Okay, so think of this as entering my private Money Models journal.And so each of these stories actually was in a journal of mine that I've kept for like whenever I see anything cool, I just write it down. I'm like, I'll save this for later. Like, it's kind of like a, like a magic card or Pokemon card or a, like a play that you wanna pull out at a later time.Like, they're, they're basically like scratch off winners. Like, they've already been scratched off, you just gotta termin for money. Like these things work and my notes were scattered all over the place and then this book was me consolidating all of them in one place.Alright, so the rest of this book in training will be all the tiny tactics I picked up that make leads and offers come together into money models. Alright, so each money model will have a visual or digital, will have a description, examples, important points summary.And then, uh, this is me making a reminder that if you ever find any, \\[...0.5s\\] uh, it out in the wild, you're like, oh, this is totally different to not cover the book. Just email it to me at valuedacquiz dot com. I will mention you, um, if it's sweet.I'm gonna be honest. Like, if, if you \\[...0.5s\\] 9 times out of 10 people were like, this is brand new. Like, that's just a free trial. Uh, haha, \\[...1.1s\\] but, \\[...0.4s\\] but if you do have something novel, I will absolutely blast it and give you all the credit in the world.Because I just want, I want this to be a living thing for motivation, is just like this one place that they can encyclopedia of offers.Okay, for everyone who thinks this won't work for my business, \\[...0.4s\\] Wanna bet, uh, every business can use any of these money models I'm about to share. I give so many examples to show you how. So instead of saying, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, that, just say how could I use this for my business. How can I make this work? And you will find the answer what would it take.Alright, so here's my big advertising law man disclaimer, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, their organizations whose sole responsibility is punishing businesses using deceptive practices. You must always observe the law, \\[...0.4s\\] law differs by city, state, country and time period.So at the time need of recording this, \\[...0.4s\\] to my knowledge, the things that we're doing are allowed in the state that I'm currently in, in the United States today.I am not saying that you should do these. These are hypothetical models to think things through that comply with your local area and time period. If it's in the future, which it will be, if you're watching this.So I tell stories of, I learn things under the Assumption of the business owners. I Learned them from did their legal diligence. When in doubt, give people their money back and just get better. It's less effort to get another customer than to fix a reputation.So I accept zero responsibility for actions that you take or don't take as a \\[...0.4s\\] result of this training. Do your own due diligence within the laws of your area and industry anti peer.Huzzah. And with that being said, this now begins our ride along apprenticeship. \\[...1.6s\\] Four types of offers that create a money model. Let's dive in.So number one is how we broke the gym industry and then we'll go into the four pronged money model, the four components, the four types of offers that exist.Alright, so how we broke the gym industry. So \\[...0.4s\\] I used to get gyms full. So what I just talked about earlier was my model at gym launch, but what created this and the reason I'm telling you the story is to show you how many different industries this structure of creating a good money model works in.And so I used to open gyms at full capacity on day one. And so this is a video, this is my first, this video, this ad \\[...0.7s\\] made me$10 million. So \\[...0.4s\\] it was sick. I was 26 and it was awesome. It is how you would imagine. It sounds, um, honestly did feel like it was something I was doing was illegal.I found out later it's completely legal to advertise and make money. It just sometimes the stars line.And so what I would do is I would go into a neighborhood \\[...0.4s\\] and, you know, this one, I did 191 sign UPS in 19 days at 500 bucks a pop. And this is me holding up all the 500 dollar contracts that I had sold like in the middle nowhere. Alright, and so this is the old way that gyms worked.And the reason I'm outlining this is cause this might be how your business works.And in the gym industry, this is what all the gurus at the time were teaching. It was something that they called the LBO model, which has nothing to do with leverage buyouts. An LBO model in the gym world was a low barrier offer.Alright, so it's like trials, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, super discount things. But the thing is, is I talked about earlier having a discount thing as the front end, but then they didn't have anything else to sell. So the discount stuff works, but you gotta have the thing to sell to make your money back. But this is how it used to work.So \\[...0.4s\\] the old way that people did low barrier offers was that they would run trial. So they'd run nineteen dollar months,$21, 21 days, things like that.And so right off the bat, if you had 10 people walk in the door, two would not buy. So now you got eight left, who buy a trial or buy the discount offer at 29 bucks, 19 bucks,$21, whatever.Now \\[...0.4s\\] this guy doesn't convert this guy doesn't convert, this guy doesn't convert this guy doesn't convert this guy doesn't convert we get three, cause the industry averages 35% of trials would convert. So not 35% of people showed up, 35% of people started the trial.So being being generous on this one, three out of the eight continue on. Alright, so this is what the math looks like. So 30 days later, our total gross profit is$600, \\[...0.4s\\] our revenue per show up \\[...1.3s\\] is$60, our revenue per trial 75\\. \\[...1.2s\\] Okay, \\[...2.3s\\] this is what we did, \\[...1.2s\\] so we would get 10 people in the door \\[...0.5s\\] now we would know now we closed fewer off the bat, \\[...0.7s\\] but we would sell the goal.So we get one person to take a 2 k package, the majority of the other ones to take, you know, 500 dollar type program, and then somebody taking half that distance of the 2,000 dollar person.Alright, so that's layer one. Then we would upsell meals because they're gonna wanna have food. Then we would upsell supplements on average$85 of gross profit per person, not revenue, gross profit.And then we get these two people to commit to a year after their duration of their program. And then we get them to prepay for the year with another discount on the back. And you could do all of this \\[...0.4s\\] in 30 days. \\[...1.0s\\] And so our total gross profit was 96.44. Remember the old one, 696\\. 44 \\[...0.7s\\] revenue per show$960 compared to 60 \\[...0.8s\\] revenue per close 1928 \\[...0.8s\\] in the first 28 days.This is how we broke the demonstrate. When I say broke early, just mean fixed. We fixed the acquisition model. \\[...1.5s\\] And so that's the math comparison. And so with the new way my gyms could outspend gyms doing the old way 25 to 1\\. It wasn't even like coming to a, to a fist fight with a knife. It was coming to a fist fight with a B52 bomber. Like, we weren't even on the ground, we're just dropping bomb.There's no, there was no way to compete, \\[...0.5s\\] and a lot of big franchises didn't, didn't catch up and basically went out of business or became just like ghosts. Like, people just didn't renew, and there's kind of, like they fizzled out and faded. And so, like, this is also a message to the people who, who do lead industries.I was a young kid \\[...1.0s\\] and I had this model, and the right move that they should have done competitively was take all my shit and immediately disseminate it.That would have been the right move. That's what Zach did with Snapchat and their stories. He just immediately, oh, I'm gonna take that, distribute it immediately.But instead they postured against her, like, this guy doesn't know what he's doing, and we ended up just destroying them, because the maths, the math, \\[...0.4s\\] like you cannot like that. You didn't innovate it, but you can't execute on it.And so one thing that I also wanna break in terms of perspective here \\[...0.6s\\] is that as much as you may not like it, a business model is not patentable. It's not IP, an offer that you may create a great headline, a free six week challenge, \\[...0.8s\\] not IP, \\[...0.6s\\] anyone can advertise an offer.And so it's a double edged sword in terms of learning this power, because it is a speed game because basically \\[...0.4s\\] you wanna advertise the stuff, you wanna rip as much money out as you can before the rest of the world catches up. And then guess what happens?When the rest of the world catches up, you do it again, \\[...0.5s\\] innovate the model again.And so there's always gonna be followers. There's always gonna be leaders, but the thing is the leaders get to make 80% of the profits because by the time everyone else catches up, we already pillaged the land \\[...0.4s\\] using a more, you know, \\[...0.4s\\] violent termination.You know, we we, we seed it and farmed the land, and we reap the fruit of \\[...0.4s\\] the land that it gave us, whatever you get it.Okay, so, uh, this was the this was the thing that broke it for them. So boom, we had service, we sold the go, so we sold way heart tickets instead of doing a 21 dollar thing. We sold nutrition and supplements, we sold continuity and they would do prepayment.So all four of these things we did in the first 30 days, and that's how we could drag the cash forward.All right, and so if for some reason, someone didn't buy the first offer thing, we had a downsuffle. We sold a goal, then we sell a small package, then we sell free trial with penalty, then we sold a free trial with no commitment, and then we did a free orientation.And so what I mean is, like, let's say somebody didn't want to do the free trial. \\[...1.7s\\] So for example, these, these people \\[...0.6s\\] they didn't buy any service, \\[...0.3s\\] but how do we get money out of them?We said, hey, no worries, why don't you just come for a nutrition orientation? We just wanna help you out for free. People come to nutrition orientation not having signed for the gym and we sell them \\[...0.4s\\] 300 bucks in supplements.So we still made money from nose by selling them a different way to get to their goal. So that was the down cell flow for service, for supplements. We would sell a full supplement bundle, then we'd sell 4 pack, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, with extras.So we'd add a couple pieces in, then we'd downsell just to a four pack. Um, and then we'd have it on continuity, then no continuity, then we'd do extras only. So we'd work our way down that whole thing. And then the meals flow, same deal.We'd work our way from biggest all the way to smallest, \\[...0.7s\\] and then continuity, we go again, sold a goal, smaller package and then month to month. And then finally the prepayment is we prepay the whole package, prepay for a discount, prepay the next month. And then we just get the commitment to say fine, you're in continuity now.And all this if you're looking at the days, this is day 21 to 28, \\[...0.7s\\] 14 to 21, \\[...1.0s\\] and these, this is up front, this is within 48 hours, \\[...1.0s\\] so all of these things are happening \\[...0.6s\\] fast. \\[...1.4s\\] Alright, so that is how we broke the gym ministry.So now let's talk about all the things that I just did, but we're gonna chunk up, so you can apply to any business, \\[...0.4s\\] all right. So there's attraction offers, UPS offers, downs offers, and community offers.The objective of each of these attraction offers is to liquidate how much it cost you to get a customer. UPS offers are to maximize profit, downs offers are to maximize \\[...0.4s\\] conversion, \\[...0.9s\\] continuity offers are stabilized cash from the business.There are many ways to accomplish the FA, some businesses can do with only one offer. Some businesses get funding, so they don't need to break even again customers, cause they have outside money that's injected into their system.But for everyone else probably watching this, I will explain a model that I have seen emerge over and over and over again within the businesses that I built.So when I look at every single amazing business that I've built that's made a lot of money, they had these things \\[...0.6s\\] pretty much in this sequence. And it doesn't happen all at once. It just often become something that you build towards.So to be very clear, I'm not saying you start with a fully fledged money model, cause it will break your \\[...0.4s\\] whole business in half. You wanna start with one, you start adding in layers like layers of paint. You just keep putting more and more layers on it.And so again, you can build an amazing business with just one or two of these things. And sometimes it's worth keeping it simple and just doing that if you can scale.I wanna scale with it as few offers as humanly possible, but I still wanna maximize how much money I make in the shortest period of time. So if I have to add more, I will to enable me scaling, but I wanna have as few as I can, cause I wanna have as little operational drag as possible.Alright, and so it has four prongs and four different vectors and different offers that correspond each objective. Alright, so this \\[...0.7s\\] beautiful little image took me a very long time to figure out, \\[...0.4s\\] right.And so we have attraction offers that bring people in the door. We have upsell offers that typically happen immediately after they get people to buy more stuff. We have downsell offers for people who, who don't see us to either of these things.So we can still get conversions, then potentially upsell them later. And then we have continuity offers on the back which get them into a recurring cash flow payment to the business. And so let's explain how they all work together to make a symphony \\[...0.4s\\] of CFA.Alright, so here we turn strangers and customers \\[...0.5s\\] get come spend more money. \\[...1.1s\\] Lower CAC is to get people, excuse me, is to get people to say yes when they would have said no, which is what you offer when they say no. And then continuity, you keep people buying, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, which is meaning you get them to buy again.Alright, so those are the four prongs, and so like I said earlier, this is just showing it through that same model, the gym watch model.So we attract, we use the books and the lead magnets and the podcast things like that. It's free. Then we sold them an upfront cash thing. Uh, so we generated up for cash with the next sale with the, uh, \\[...0.6s\\] the, uh, 16 weeks.Then we would maximize profit by getting the upsell supplements, then sells our supplements on behalf. And then we book continuity which is the three year licensing, which is the 42,000 year and note, I'm not saying that you have to use all four.I'm just saying I noticed that my most successful companies did, and many companies, you only use one or two.Okay, so let's look at the model that I showed earlier with weight loss. We had a free promo get people in. We got cash by selling challenges that they can get their money back or sell to goal, either one.Then we would sell supplements, \\[...0.6s\\] then we would sell memberships \\[...2.4s\\] all the way through \\[...1.2s\\] rental car, \\[...0.8s\\] 19 bucks a day gets me in the door, \\[...1.4s\\] then \\[...0.4s\\] pretty much everything was up sales.So these kind of, all happened at once, so I'm saying, like, this is just a model, like, it's, it's more about the business, so we had all the insurance, the late pay the late payback the gas, the upgrade in the car, all that stuff.All right, and then continuity is where they say, great, do you wanna enter our rewards program? And so great money models can include multiple in the same business, so you can notice here, like, there's some here, there's multiples, here, there was insurance, there's multiple upsell.So it's not like you only have to have one, you can have multiple things there through the rest of our time together.I'll show you genius ways that other entrepreneurs have stacks and recommine. These things make lots of money. And I will only show the ones that I also then used model that in my businesses and what we did.All right, \\[...0.9s\\] good job. Four types of offers. So with that being said, we will begin our ride along apprenticeship, which is the next one. \\[...2.0s\\] So we just cover the 3 levels. Let's rock into money models and offer stacks.Alright, so, uh, you will notice throughout this whole training that some of the things are a little bit different from the book. And that's done on purpose because I like to think through things differently in different mediums.All right, cause I can say things here that I couldn't normally say in the book. So we'll go definition run across story and the gym launch example.All right. So \\[...0.4s\\] a money model is a series of offers. That's it. The reason I had to start with the offers book before talking with the money model book is that an offer is one unit. A money model is sequencing these things, is putting them in a series of offers deliberately. 2 maximized gross profit collected in the first 30 days. So I will say this all together.A money model is a series of offers. A good money model, which is the objective of this book or this training is a series of offers structure to minimize CAQ, how much it cost you get a customer, maximize gross profit, how much they pay you collected in the first 30 days, how fast they pay you? That's the point. \\[...1.9s\\] So \\[...0.6s\\] I'll tell you a story, \\[...1.1s\\] so I, we've all seen a money model happening.Some of you guys just didn't know it was happening to you. So \\[...0.4s\\] I remember this crazy example. One time I was, I was going I think I was going to Colorado for some reason went to Colorado.I, you know, I line up, I'm like on my phone waiting in line for a couple minutes, and then they pull me up to the rental car counter, right? And the lady was like, hi there, you know, very like chipper, I just remember big chipper anyways.And so \\[...0.5s\\] she asked me a number of questions as she's going through the rental car process. So she says, \\[...0.4s\\] hello, sir, can I have your ID so I can look up your reservation? And so I'm barely looking for my phone. I'm like, yeah, here you go. And so she, you know, extends her hands smiling.And I've been waiting for a few minutes, right. So I just wanted to get my car, so him ID, cool. So then, \\[...0.5s\\] and I'm at that counter, you can see, like I'm kind of like lean over and so, so does it look like \\[...0.4s\\] we have the car that you reserved?Are you okay with a tundra? It's red. And so I was like, yeah, sure, that's fine, whatever. And so I'm not really paying attention. And then she says, okay, I've got you down for three days.Would you like to have a late return so you don't have to worry about late fees or turn in time, \\[...0.6s\\] you know, if you're on in a rush to get your plane flight.So she asked her head kind of like with her head cocked, and I was like, yeah, I guess that's fine, flexibility is good. And so she's like, okay, um, great so give me a second, just putting that in.Would you like to upgrade your insurance to cover any bumps and scratches in the car? It covers any and all damage that occurs in the vehicle during your stay. And so I was like, no, I'm good.I have no plans on drag racing, right? It's ha ha ha. And she's like, okay, so just the minimum insurance then? And I said, yeah, that's fine. I barely looked up, right. I'm just like going through the cell and make the car. And she's like, okay, then I have your keys ready in a second.Do you wanna prepay for your fuel so you don't have to worry about filling it up? Uh, you just, you can return it on empty and not have to worry about paying. Uh, we fuel gas at 3.75 a gallon. And I was like, well, what's gas cost around here? She was, she was like three 50\\. And I was like, \\[...0.6s\\] 25 cents, you know, per gallon, yeah, sure, that, that checks out that, that works. And so I was like, two extra two hundred two dollars and fifty cents. I was like, what sounds reasonable?That's not a big deal. I don't have to worry about it. So boom, sign me up for, I'll prepay the gas. And so she says, Alrighty, then.Well, here's your ID, can you sign here for me? Great, there's your receipt on the back. I circled the parking space, just go around the corner and pass the restroom sign.Go past the first three columns and you'll see the J space on your left. Your tundra should be about halfway down. Enjoy your trip. Alright, and so mind you, right, I take my thing, I'm walking away, right? And I look at my receipt and I just paid 400 bucks for a three day rental when I'd reserved online for$19 a day. And I was like, I went from 19 bucks a day \\[...0.4s\\] to$400. What had just happened? A well engineered money model. And I remembered that moment and I was like, I need to write this down.This is the perfect example of what it looks like to create a money model, a series of offers structured sequentially to monetize the customer and provide as much value as really possible.So if we think through each of the upsells, she first upgraded my car from a Toyota Yarus to a Toyota Tundra by saying that my reservation wasn't there. Now \\[...0.4s\\] in my life, I've never had the car that I've reserved, actually failed out of.Some of you guys said, I feel like I've never actually had the car that I asked for there.So this is the classic Seinfeld joke. He's like, oh no, I think you know how to \\[...0.5s\\] take the reservation, but you don't know how to hold the reservation. And that's, that's, that's the main part of the reservation, right. And so we went from, and just from that, I went from$19 a day,$69 a day right now.She solved my big guy in a, in a small car problem by offering it now. Did they probably have another Yaris, like, vehicle? Probably \\[...0.7s\\] she just made the offer, and I said yes.Second one she did was late checkout, so this would be at a half day or one time feed of my reservation.Now, um, I think I should, I came right to climb the off, but the point is, is that they made this fee up to begin with. This is the main part of this, is that \\[...0.7s\\] the idea of late checkout only exists, because they decide that if you check out past the time that they made up arbitrarily is now late.And so what I wanna really put into your minds right now is that we're, I'm explaining the policies, but there's a game maker who made the rules of the game. They created this fee.Think about the, like, if you start rental cars, you don't immediately say, oh, if someone comes back an hour later, I'm gonna charge them.You don't think, we think that now, because that's how it's that's how it's always been, but it wasn't always like that. Some guy figured it out, and then every other rental car started doing it.The next one was the insurance upgrade. Now a lot of you guys saw me not take this, \\[...0.6s\\] but I did take insurance. I didn't even realize it, and I use this for everything after this point. And so she said, do you want to upgrade your shirts \\[...0.8s\\] now implied in the language is that I already have insurance \\[...0.8s\\] by saying, do you want to upgrade your insurance?And so some customers will take the upgrade, which is fine, \\[...0.6s\\] but the real sale \\[...1.4s\\] is the minimum package. She then said, oh, would you want the minimum? Then \\[...1.5s\\] you don't want anything else, do you?Those are implied sales. Do you want anything else besides the thing I just said \\[...0.4s\\] the minimum offer meaning you have to get it because it's minimum, but the thing is that \\[...0.6s\\] you don't have to buy it a lot of, by the way, credit cards already have rental car insurance built in if you have Amex, for example, when you do trips on Amex, they cover rental car insurance. And so this is pure profit for that.All right, so pro tip for you, but the thing is, and this is the pro, this is the really sexy thing is that, this is masterful naming, so if you have multiple packages, you can downsell your minimum package, knowing that 90% of people might take it simply because you called the minimum package instead of saying, hey, this is my shitty package. Think about how different minimum is versus \\[...0.7s\\] economy package.Right, minimum is like, well, okay, I have to get it \\[...0.5s\\] right, \\[...0.8s\\] kind of interesting alright, so next one is prepay gas. Now this one was, uh, sneaky in that the way it's positioned to be very clear. You wanna make sure the customer understands things. Alright, now this one particularly was one that I did the math. And I thought it was like, okay, 25 cents extra per gallon.That's it. That's a fine deal, the way it actually works, by the way \\[...0.4s\\] is you prepay the whole tank, \\[...0.7s\\] so you buy a full tank, and I think the tundra, like, whatever 25 gallons in it. So I actually had paying$93 for a tank of gas up front, and so basically, whatever I don't use is profit for them.And so I use half a tank. Not only did they, I charge 25 cents more for the gallon, but \\[...0.7s\\] the half thing I didn't use is just extra is extra profit for them, but the advantages when you turn it in.You don't have to fill it up, cause \\[...0.8s\\] so think about this, they create a fee to avoid a fee, \\[...1.4s\\] because if you turn the imagine, I had a rental car company.I could say turn, turn the car with whatever amount of gas you have, and I fill the car back up, \\[...0.4s\\] and that, that could just be factored into my price. But instead, or I could just say we fill it up at this rate, whatever you don't fill up, we'll fill it up, and we'll charge your card afterwards.That would be an easy way to do it, but instead they say we're gonna charge you more. We charge you$5 a gallon or fifth or$10 a gallon if you \\[...0.8s\\] turn \\[...0.4s\\] the car in with less than full gas if you turn the car in with less than full gas, but then you prepay the whole tank.Then you still bought the whole tank \\[...0.3s\\] to avoid paying the fee that they're then also still going to fill the car back up again, \\[...0.7s\\] again.Like, I say this so that you can understand \\[...0.4s\\] the, the thought process that went into structuring the sales process. Like, there's a reason these guys do billions a month \\[...0.7s\\] in sales.And for those of you who are like, man, I don't like this, \\[...0.7s\\] the rental car industry wouldn't exist. They actually run very thin margins, like, there's, there's, you know, I mean like it's not, like, they're, they're raking it in here. There's people who crashed the car.There's a lot of other costs to go into running a car, \\[...0.6s\\] and so \\[...0.4s\\] for you, you cannot shy away from capitalism.I mean, if you wanna be a business owner, \\[...0.4s\\] you have to make a profit in order to be able to scale your business to help more people. And if they did not make this profit \\[...0.6s\\] there, it would be a wild inconvenience for us. Now Uber, then exist later, much later. Uh, that can sort of help but still having rental car company.There is nice. Okay, \\[...0.4s\\] finally, there's damages, that's an implicit up cell. If you scratch the car, you gotta pay, alright, and then late return yet again. They invented the line, then we had to pay for it. Okay, and so these are all the offers that they offered to me in that one conversation.And so for those of you who are afraid of making a second and third and fourth and fifth offer. Did it seem like she's like, I was annoyed?Not really, and also what is the price I have to pay to business owner? What do I get if the cost is that one out of 20 customers \\[...0.5s\\] gets upset, \\[...0.9s\\] one out of 20 people is just crazy \\[...0.6s\\] period if you deal with general population for those business owners to do, I came from Gen Pop, so I get it.There's just crazy people. And you don't wanna \\[...0.7s\\] not make offers to 19 out of 20 sane people because of one crazy person. And so the cost should be maybe you don't have a business, or you don't make a profit, or you have one out of 20 people complaint to me. The trade is clear, and I'm still gonna make the trade. \\[...2.1s\\]And so my goal is that you walk away by the end of this book, and training with eyes tuned to finding money models, \\[...0.5s\\] alright, in understanding what makes them work.And studying some of the biggest brands in the world will become an endless learning experience for you, which is what I absolutely recommend is look at their money models.If someone's been around 30 years in the same industry, they have figured it out. Look at what they do, and the cool thing is you can take things from rental cars and apply it to insurance. You can take things from here and apply it to, to teeth whitening.Like, it doesn't matter you take this from here and turn into plumbing. Like, they all these models are more psychology in terms of how they work and get and are persuasive than they are industry specific.So that's my rental car story, so \\[...0.4s\\] Jim launched just to give you an idea, when we went from$1,000 my bank account to$17 million in profit in 20 months.So remember December 2016, thousand dollars my bank account 20 months later$17 million in profit, \\[...0.5s\\] the only way that happens is through having a money mall. And it only scaled because insanely fast because of our insane Cush refinance acquisition.So remember level 2 was, \\[...0.5s\\] sir, level 3, it should say level 3 is two times cack, right?It should say level three. Okay, so this, these were actual metrics, so people don't share this. These are the actual metrics, is that our 30 gross profit was 6 k, our CAC was 500, \\[...0.4s\\] our 12 month gross profit was 48,000, \\[...0.9s\\] CAC \\[...1.4s\\] 40,000 k.So if I have an investment for you and you pay me$500 and I pay you$48,000 back in the end of the years at a good investment. Now what if I said you can do it as many times as you want? You would put as much money into that machine as you possibly could.Now the real question is \\[...0.8s\\] what's your budget? If I said I've got this ATM machine you put$500 in and then$48,000 comes out, would you budget yourself? Would you say, hey, I'm only spending$5,000 a month on this?Of course you wouldn't. That's why the idea of marketing budget is ridiculous. If you design a proper design money model, you can out make the budget. And then the budget doesn't matter.The point is to spend as much as you possibly get within KPI, \\[...0.8s\\] KPI meaning keep performance indicators all right. And so our 30 day GPU cock was 12 to 1\\. So within one month, if I spent$500, I got$6,000 back in the first month.So I'm making money, \\[...0.6s\\] making money. And so this would these, this is the actual this is like the offer stack for Jim Lodge so far as we had a free book Lead Magnet podcast, that was the front end, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, so we got people in our world to see what we were about.Then the second offer we had as a free strategy go to apply the stuff that they Learned here into their business. So we say hey, \\[...0.4s\\] and the way that we did this was, uh, we said, listen, leave your card at home, we wanna help you out, and if it's a good fit, we'll invite you to another call.That way was low pressure, I'd say leave your card, don't worry about it. Then we'd, um, we'd do the second call, and then we'd offer the, the 16,000 dollar thing which is 16 thousand fill your gym intensive. So that was our premium offer, uh, with very attractive payment terms.So they could put a thousand dollars down than to pay a thousand dollars a week, which no one did. And to this day, to my knowledge, no one else ever has none.And the reason we could do that is cause we actually made the money. \\[...1.2s\\] And so most gyms couldn't afford the$16,000, most of them, but we could make them more than$16,000 in their first month, and then they would pay for it. So I just wanna get as many people say yes, cause I knew we could crush it for \\[...1.0s\\] now. Offer 3 \\[...0.4s\\] was a supplement selling secrets course or training.This was free, \\[...0.5s\\] alright, that was cool about this, so it was free. All we had to do was get them to buy products. We'd give them the training for free, and then we would get them to sell the products.When I say get them to, I just like, we explained how they would make more money \\[...0.5s\\] selling these products and why they were specifically made for jibs. And so I had price Protection that no other company would offer.They got to use basically backdoor links for their customers, said that they were the good guys rather than me being the good guy.So, like, one of the things that I hated about other brands was, like, I would sell at this price, but they would compete against me online. So I would get them the customer, and then the customer switch to them. And I hated that.And so as a gym owner, cause I'm like, I'm paying for this cost, like I'm just transferring over to another brand that feels bad.And so what we did was we said we're gonna be priced here online. You can offer this price in store, and then that way people always keep buying from you. So I made that advantage, and obviously we just made the economics work for us on the back of it.And that's how this the supplement company started the first month doing 1.7 million a month. Cause we actually solve the problem for gyms. They didn't have to carry inventory, we would do it. We allowed themselves subscriptions cause we've deliver on it.So we solved all these problems that I wish I had as a gym owner. I made a company that would solve it. \\[...1.6s\\]And so then the fourth thing we did was you did a free feedback call, so this was basically saying, okay, you know, you're halfway through your eight weeks in. Let's, let's talk about, you know, where you're at. How much money did you make?Cool, so what we did was a free, uh, free with commitment offer, which is something that we'll talk about in the fourth section of this training, which is continuity offers.And so basically, what we would say is, hey, you have 16 weeks, \\[...0.6s\\] you're eight weeks in \\[...0.5s\\] say yes now, and I'll give you all the, the stuff that you're gonna get over the next three years. If you say yes today, \\[...0.5s\\] and you'll just keep paying your existing thing.So you're just gonna get more for nothing, and then the end of the six weeks or so, end of the eight weeks, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, the next eight, right, 16 total.Eight halfway point \\[...0.4s\\] at the end of the next eight, it'll just revert into this cheaper billing that you get for a longer period of time. And so they were currently paying$1,000 a week. They would say, yes, get more value, not pay more, keep going. And at the end, it would fall down to a lower rate.And all that the objective of this bonus was, was to get them to agree to continuity on the back, \\[...1.0s\\] specifically a higher level of continuity, cause we had a, kind of, built in continuity which was super cheap.That was, like, I think 500 bucks a month, something like that. But what we wanted them to get to was the thirty two hundred dollar a month level \\[...0.4s\\] that, uh, that the up sale, um, offered. So that's how we got so many people say us, and to be fair, that's how we, um, did it for years.No, it doesn't have to be complicated, if anything simple scales. So you wanna have as few offers as possible that allow you to make the most gross profit possible in the shortest amount of time.Alright, so understanding how to do this can change your business forever. So that is fundamentally examples of money models and what amount money model is \\[...0.6s\\] great \\[...0.7s\\] kaboom. Now we talk about the 4 types of offers that create money models to begin with"

So you can profitably acquire customers and scale.So \\[...0.5s\\] let's do a quick putting it all together, so overview \\[...0.6s\\] a money model, attraction offer, up sales, downseas continuity. We have covered all four. If you are starting out, just pick one of the money models to inspire you to do something in your business.Alright, if you're more advanced, you can start weaving two together. There are no rules for this. You can stack these. So you absolutely can do an attraction offer that you use as an upsell offer in your business. You can use a continuity offer on the front to attract customers.All of these things are possible. I try to present them in this way in the most logical format that I have tended to use them in my business, but there are no rules in business as long as it is legal. So I leave that to you.Alright, examples. This is my fitness offer, so I try to conceptualize this for you. So, okay, \\[...0.4s\\] on the front end, I ran a win your money back offer. Then we would upsell from a service perspective for anybody who bought that. We'd upsell buy X, get why free.So this would be them prepaying time and then we would upsell the continuity bonus.Great, so that would be the role of Rupsell now. If someone \\[...0.5s\\] didn't wanna do win your money back, then we would downsell the free trial with penalty. And then we would \\[...0.4s\\] DOS the menu upsell in terms of supplements, and then we do the roll over UPS on the back end.And so this \\[...0.4s\\] was fundamentally monomodel. So I use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the offers that I talked about to make the money model that we had for fitness. This model was superior to other models on the market, which is why our gyms consistently out compete other gyms in the marketplace.All right, so this is Jim Launches model. So we used a decoy offer, that was the strategy call, that was the, you can also consider it a free with consumption, depending on how you want to see it.But we had that offer, then we did a classic upsell, \\[...0.9s\\] then we did the menu, menu up sell on the back end into what level of service they wanted for the extended period of time. Did you want these other services that went with \\[...0.6s\\] gym launch.I started Gym Legacy, which was the back end that we had. So some people opted for the highest version.Some people said, you know, I don't need, like, agency services, I just want the ads, like you don't have to run them. Hey, uh, but I do want you to, uh, train my sales team. And so we would basically menu up sell the features that we thought would be best for them now.If people didn't take the offer, we had, uh, payment plan feature down, sell free trial, \\[...0.4s\\] right, and said this, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \\[...0.4s\\] 6 of the structures that I went over for this presentation is what created the gym launch Money Mob \\[...0.9s\\] now, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, newsletter and consulting. So I just love this money models, just like one of my favorite ones. Uh, cause I mentioned it, uh, during this video, uh, trading a couple times.But this was an attraction offer, which is a free trial. You're like, wait, how can you use free trials, an attraction offer?Yes, there are no rules, so we used a free trials, the attraction offer, the thing that made it cash flows, the pay less now, pay more later option of saying, hey, we'll get you the past newsletters.And technically this was combined with a lifetime lower rate. So this is a continuity discount and a pay less, pay less now, pay more later put together as one. This was the thing that got them to engage, so free trial start 3.99 a month, oh wait, let me give you two years of newsletters today, and give you this discount if you choose to skip your trial. And then of course, the, uh, the back end on that one was \\[...0.5s\\] the business, you know, Upsold Consulting at things like that.If it were me, this is just that, that particular business. If were me, I would do Bix got y free here. So now that I've got the continuity, I would then say great, now that you're in continuity, if you buy seven, I'll give you five, \\[...0.7s\\] and then I can frontload even more cash.Now if, if I know that people stay on average 2 years, then I wouldn't do that, cause that would lose me money. But if people say let's stay on average another 3 months, then it makes sense to do buy 6 get 6, cause I still double TV \\[...0.4s\\] and get that cash up front. \\[...1.5s\\]So these were actually my original notes, so I, I wanna show you how mine actually looked. Um, and I've changed some of the names, uh, to make them a little bit more like friendly. Uh, but this is actually what it looked like in terms of how I would design, \\[...0.5s\\] uh, the money models. And so the possibilities \\[...0.4s\\] really are endless.So let's go through steps for making your own. So step one is you start with instruction offered or always starts with getting people to engage, getting leads to engage with you.Step two is you pick an upsell offer. You figure out, okay, the people have come in, they're coming off when your money back, they're coming on, uh, buy XY free, they're coming on \\[...0.6s\\] decoy offer, whatever it is, they're coming on the front end.You say, great, now I'm either gonna do a menu up sell, I'm gonna do an Ankara anchor up sell, I'm gonna do a rollover up sell. All of those things you can do as your second, second piece. Then you can pick your downsell offer. So what if they say no to any of these other offers?Well, we have our entire downsell flow which is we start with payment plans, uh, then we do a free trial or we do payment plan to feature down sell, then we get a free trial. You just pick the ones that you know that you can execute on right now.Step 4, then you pick a continuity offer, and the result is that you get your cash back in 30 days, more customers and make more money.So here's some notes, one perfect, one of these at a time. If you try and do all four at once or six of these things at once, you're gonna break your business. Like, I strongly recommend just start with one. One is enough.There's already enough complexity you doing anything new that you haven't done before. I try to include as many important notes as I know that make these things work in these trainings, in the book.There's some things that are in this video training that are in the book, there's some things in the book that are in the video training. So it is, \\[...1.0s\\] so \\[...0.4s\\] read both if you're really serious about it, but if you have enough from either of them by all means, please take action.All right, now if you are going to, uh, start one of these things, start it with a lower price, get people to say yes, and then start raising prices in stages. That's my recommendation payment plans based on how I told you to present the, \\[...0.5s\\] uh, the discounted rate.Uh, basically prepayment discount versus the payment plan rate is a great way to get, kind of, a look into the future of what prices the market will sustain.I like this little saying simple scales, fancy fails. I wanna have as few of these as humanly possible, because the fewer pieces I have my business, the fewer things can break.And so I would rather start with the simplest possible thing that accomplished the objective, which is that I can offset my costume car customers. I can recycle that cash within 30 days. And I keep scaling, basically removing acquisition as the bottleneck of my business.Once I've accomplished that, we have accomplished our objective. We no longer need outside money to scale, which is pretty sweet. This is a little bit of an advanced step. Affiliate products can fill money model gaps. So if you're like, okay, why wanna do a by XQI free?Then just do a by XQI free on someone else's product. So then you can still sell your main thing and then use somebody else's product that you send traffic so you can get cash. You have no operational constraints.Now you can use that for complimentary services rather than something that's gonna take away from your core offer. You can turn attraction offers into continuity offers automatically just with renewal bias y free. For example, if I said buy 6 get 6, it becomes a continuity offer.If after the end of that first year, it rolls into continuity. If I do win your money back and say hey, after this period, you then roll into continuity. If I say decoy offer, I could say, hey, you paid.You can either do this, \\[...0.6s\\] you know, this, this simple thing that's not that good, or this amazing thing for more money that has a guarantee after that period.It rolls in continuity, so you can take any attraction offer that I had, and just immediately turn into continuity by just saying adding a clause. It says it rolls into continuity at this price, and again, you can mix and match these however you like.So I, I present them in this order, because this is the most logical order that I can think of, and \\[...0.4s\\] as I have used them in my businesses, but this is no, in no way \\[...0.4s\\] a limitation on your ability to innovate.And honestly, I want you, I want you to send me all the cool money models you guys figure out. Like, that's the point.This is me just showing you all the stuff that I know that I could fit into a presentation within a recent amount of time. Um, and so again, right, you can use attraction offers up, so \\[...0.9s\\] anything that you can, that you can put your mind, you can figure out.Okay, so that is how you make the money model, and let's go to 10 years in 10 minutes. \\[...1.8s\\] So we just walk through how to make your own money Model. Now we're gonna do 10 years of my life, more like 13 or 14, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, but 10 years is him. It sounds sexier. So we're gonna call it that. Alright, so where money model fits in the grand scheme of thing.So my first book, 100 million offers, answer the question which I sell, answer an offer, so good people feel stupid saying no.My second book, 100 Billion Dollar leads, answer the next national question. How do I find these people? Answer you advertise \\[...0.4s\\] this book, 100 Million Dollar Money Models answers the next natural question, how do we get them to buy answer a money model.So what we covered a money model is a series of offers designed to increase how many customers you get, how much they pay, and how fast they pay it. It's a deliberate series of offers. A good money model makes more profit from a customer than it cost to get and service them in the first 30 days. That's the bare minimum.A 100 million dollar money model makes more profit from one customer than it cost to get and service many customers in the first 30 days, which removes cash as a limited or scale in your business. This is what gives you limitless scale.This is how I've scaled. Let's see, I got Alan from zero to 1.7 million a month in six months. I got Jim launch from zero to 4.4 million months in 20 months. Uh, we've gotten, I can't say the school metrics.I'll just say that they're even better. Uh, yes, um, we have other copies, the portfolio that we scaled at that same level of speed.Alright, and so if you can master this skill, this may be the single most valuable thing that I can give you, which is why the subheadline of this book is how to make money.Money models have four types of offers, attraction offers, UPS offers downso offers and continuity offers. Attraction offers get customers by offering something free or to discount. Often they also make money by offering a better deal at a higher price that we covered.We covered five, we covered win your money back, which is where you set a goal for the customer and tell them how to reach it, and if they reach it, then they qualify to get their money back or get it as store credit.We covered giveaways where you advertise a chance to win a big prize in exchange for contact information in anything else that you want from this prospect. After picking a winner, you offer everyone else \\[...0.4s\\] the big prize at a discounted price.In second place, \\[...0.6s\\] the decoy offers are also attraction offers where you advertise it for your discounted offer. When the lead asks to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium offer.The premium offer includes more features, benefits, bonuses, guarantees and so on, and gets more people to buy it. Buy is get y free. You offer customers free stuff in exchange for buying stuff for money.The more free stuff in, the higher its value, the more people buy X to get y free, \\[...0.5s\\] pay less now or pay more later. You give people a choice to pay full price later or pay a discounted price now for additional benefits.We also did free with consumption which I won't bonus here, but fundamentally you give away a lot of free value, and that increases the likely people buy a very expensive thing from you.The more expensive the thing, the longer and the more free stuff you give them, then we have upsell offers, which is are whatever you offer next.That is my very literal scientific thing try and break, like, fight me, and upsell is whatever you offer next. Alright, so typically it's gonna be more better or newer version, whatever they just bought. These can get you lots of cash fast.We covered 4, \\[...0.6s\\] the classic UPS out where you offer the solution to customer's next problem the moment they become aware of it.You can't have X without Y, \\[...0.7s\\] the menu up sell, you tell customers which options they don't need, then tell them which one they do need and how to get the value from it prescribe, \\[...0.4s\\] and you don't need that, you need this.The Acre Up sells you offer the most expensive thing first. If the customer bulks, you offer a much cheaper and still acceptable alternative.No worries, you don't care about X, this may be a better fit for you. D rollover upsells you credit sell more all the customers previous purchased towards your next offer. Since you already spent$500, I'll just credit that towards staying a full year. Pick your price which I ended up not including this. I'll probably make a YouTube video about it.Downsell office are whatever \\[...0.4s\\] you offer after someone says no. That's my scientific \\[...0.4s\\] answer for that, \\[...0.4s\\] and by turning Nos into yeses, you make more money.We covered 3 of my favorites, so payment planned outsells you offer the same product to the same price, but they pay some now in the rest over time, when you get paid.Let's do half now and half then \\[...0.4s\\] try with penalty. You let customers try your product or service for free, so long as they meet your terms. If they do, then they have a better chance of becoming paying customers.If they don't, they pay. If you do X y Z, I'll let you start for free feature downsells you lower prices by changing what the customer gets.I offer lower quantity, lower quality or lower price alternatives or cut optional components altogether. If you're okay without a guarantee, I can knock off$400. That's how that works. Then we had continuity offers which provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing payments for until they cancel. These boost the profit of every customer and give you one last thing to sell.We covered three of my favorites Continuity bonus offers. So with a continuity bonus, you give the customer an awesome thing if they sign up today.Typically the bonus itself is more valued than the first continuity payment. If you sign up today, you also get XYZ valuable thing. And if you want them to stick, you can continue to give them bonuses to maintain the service, cut nudity discount offers.We covers the second type.We covered first month back in commitments, and you give the customer free time now, now or later \\[...0.4s\\] if they sign up today.Is the key point is that there's four different places that you can spread it out. At the front, at the end, in the middle, in between. That's the point spread out over the whole thing, but that is fundamentally how cotton duty offers work to get people to sign up. Then we have the way fee offers.So first you ask a customer to pay a starter fee as part of adjoining a month's month program.Then you offer discount the entire fee if they commit to the longer term. If they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee \\[...0.4s\\] premium, which I didn't, I cut from this one. I'll make a YouTube video about it cause I think it really only applies to software. I thought that was too much.All right, you build money models one stage at a time. Once I get customers reliably, then I make sure that they pay for themselves reliably, then I make sure that they pay for other customers reliably, then I start maximizing each customer's long term value. Then I print as much money as I possibly can.Bottom line, \\[...0.7s\\] the knowledge in these bullets brought me more free and profit customers than I've known what to do with. If executed, they will do the same for you, and with that \\[...0.4s\\] cash will no longer be a constraint in your business.I hope that this book and this training helps you guys grow your dream as big as you darn will please. \\[...1.2s\\] That is 10 years and 10 minutes. So the next one we'll just put it all together, and put a nice bow on it, and we'll wrap this puppy up. \\[...1.7s\\]Alright, we just covered 10 years in 10 minutes, so now let's put this whole thing together in a bow, we're rounding home, we're going towards home plate, we're in the end zone, we're in the red zone, we're finishing this out.Alright, \\[...0.4s\\] so my quick final words, so this is, uh, something that I finished 100 million dollar leads with, and I just, it's something that I, I really believe a lot in. So this is a screenshot taken without permission from Ray Dalio's \\[...0.4s\\] book principles.Uh, and this is basically his, his, his concept of learning principles overall is that you have big goals, \\[...0.5s\\] then you fail, \\[...0.5s\\] then you learn principles from the failure, then you improve, and then you set more audacious goals. And so fundamentally this is the learning process.My goal with all the stuff that I have is that I just share the stuff that I've Learned. I'm not saying this is the only way to do business. I'm saying we've now done, we've crip both three businesses, two \\[...0.4s\\] or four businesses past$100 million enterprise value, two or three, I think past$100 million.I think thirds about to$800 million a year plus an annual revenue. And so \\[...0.8s\\] I can't say how to do$1 billion a year in sales. I don't, I don't know that yet. But I can say the get$200 million, we've done it multiple times and it terms better price value more times than that.And \\[...0.5s\\] the stuff that I shared is the stuff that I know works. And so I recommend doing it that way, so that I could hopefully save you this part, and just have you go from here to here and beyond. \\[...1.5s\\]And so I will read this, uh, this fun little, this little snapshot that Layla got this earlier on her career this is before I became Instagram famous, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, before I started making YouTube videos. Um, this is what I just done, Jim watching.We're just doing our own thing being private. Um, and so Layla snapped this when I wasn't looking, and I was like, damn, I look pensive AF. Uh, anyways, this is 2nd time we taken a private jet, and it was dope. They figure if you go down with the ship, your seatbelt won't save you.Regardless to every hard motherfucker who's disappointing their parents, wives, husbands, friends, fake friends and everyone else who doubts you.No. 1, I'm your biggest fan. No 2, it's about to get real, so get hard fast. No. 3, \\[...0.4s\\] you cannot lose if you do not quit. I used to repeat \\[...0.5s\\] that to myself over and over again when I didn't wanna keep doing it. If you feel hopeless, welcome entrepreneurship. If you feel like you'll never make it, you're on the right path.If you feel like you're disappointment to everyone, you know, keep fucking moving. Because the end of the rainbow isn't a pot of gold. It's you, it's the real you that's been underneath all long whispering in your ear, just one more step, one more call, one more sale.And when I say that I'm your biggest fan, it's because I was there. And I know that, because I know exactly what it feels like having both 100% confidence and a thousand percent doubt at the same time.So here's all you gotta do, just keep moving, keep fighting, keep improving, your time will come. Success is the only revenge. So it's been my great pleasure putting this all together for you. Um, I hope that you should surpass me in every way humanly possible. If you do, then I will have succeeded.If you die without sharing all your knowledge, you have wasted your life. And I mean that, um, making real business education accessible everyone has been my personal mission. And it's been the joy of my life, the most stressful thing that I've done, um, up to this point. So I continue to do it. Um, and in accomplishing your dreams, you help me accomplish mine.So \\[...0.7s\\] the possibilities are endless. I hope to hear the combinations most nation puts together so I can add them to the repertoire. If you have a company, by the way, that does a related dollars and profit is cash flowing \\[...0.5s\\] and founder LED, you can go to acquisition. Com. We can see if we can help you scale.You can just hit the scale button. If you're looking to sell a business we really like at this point, probably look at companies that are worth, \\[...0.7s\\] I don't know,$50 million plus, like, \\[...0.4s\\] it should be a big business. And if you're not there yet, that's fine. Just going will help you scale.Alright, and so, um, if you're at neither of those levels, then consider going through the hundred million dollar offers and hundred million dollar leads books and the corresponding trainings. They're free on my site if you have$0. They are also$0 again on my site. If you're an audio person, you can listen to them, um, on my podcast. Say the leads book and the audio for the offers book are both there.So if you're like, I'm broke as hell, I get it. That's why I have that stuff for free. Alright, so \\[...0.4s\\] if you're struggling to figure out who to sell to, you go to acquisition, not conference app slash Avatar.So this is like a single that I released, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, between books. Uh, because I got a lot of questions about, like, really specific to Avatar stuff. So I wrote a whole chapter on that, that you can go grab.All right, we'll just pop your email and we'll send it to you. Um, if you're struggling to figure out what to sell. That's what I made 100 million offers for. You can scan the, ur, code if you're, uh, \\[...0.6s\\] struggling with getting people to buy.My next book will be persuasion in sales. Maybe I don't know, we'll keep it mysterious. Uh, and if you want a job at acquisition.com. Or one of our portfolio companies who love hiring Lizzy Nation, just go to acquisition.com for slash careers, slash open slash jobs.Uh, but probably just careers will take you there. And you can see all the openings across all of our, uh, portfolio companies. So if you're a savage, and it would take 5 people replacing your business, we would like to talk to you. Uh, beyond that.That is the end of my presentation, \\[...0.4s\\] and \\[...0.4s\\] love you all. Keep murdering it. I meant what I said, you accomplishing your dreams, accomplished mine. So keep cashing it \\[...0.7s\\] out."

Obviously, we make as much money as you want, but you don't wanna make more money on a few customers \\[...0.4s\\] when you can get 10 times the customers, and then make way more on the second sale.Right, and so often up sales make up the majority of the profit, even if that's not the thing you sell.The most of thing in terms of volume, I might sell 10 times more of my friend and offer, but \\[...0.4s\\] 10 x of my profit comes from my second sale. They can make or break a money model, and so let me show you how much, so here's some examples, \\[...0.4s\\] so this is a classic burger fries and soda store.Alright, so this is a very sad burger shop owner, he sells a burger for two bucks. This cost on the burger is dollar seventy five. He makes 25 cents a profit. He cries himself to sleep every night, very sad. Now he is a happy tier.Isn't that nice of going from 25 cents for sale to one dollar seventy five cents for sale by adding in and up sale of fries, and then up sale of soda and the up sale of quantity of. Do you wanna supersize your whole thing?So, it's like, do you wanna make that a meal? Do you wanna supersize that boom up sale one, up sale two? And the thing is that \\[...0.4s\\] when they make this up sale, look at how much more they make for sale. A lot more.And so the end result of this goes from ￠25 \\[...0.7s\\] 2 \\[...0.5s\\] eat X the gross profit per sale they're making way more 2 one dollar and seventy five cents from ￠25 originally and so the thing is that you may just be one offsell offer away for making yours into a dynasty like theirs \\[...0.5s\\] you just have to figure out what's your fries and a Coke \\[...0.3s\\] and if you don't someone else will let me talk about when they fail upsell offers fail or feel cringy when you offer something that they don't want so that's either too different or doesn't solve their existing problem you offered at the wrong time since before they've experienced the problem you say hey \\[...0.4s\\] you just had a steak do you want another steak they're like well I'm not really hungry anymore you already solved that and try to solve the same problem you offer the wrong way which is they don't believe you they're like sure that would be nice but I don't believe you specifically or is a combination of the above this is what it fails now what to sell which becomes the next upsell offer question more of what they just got think quantity so that's uh one burger to two burgers better versions of it think quality so this is why have a mystery meat burger when you give a sirloin meat burger organic burger or newer complimentary stuff think different this is do you want fries and a soda with that burger fundamentally that's how this works so \\[...0.4s\\] the objective of the upsell is to maximize profit per customer and ascend clients into backends note these structures that I talk about with the upsells work anywhere I just prefer them as essential tools a lot of these things could also be front ends each of the offers that I explain in money models 1 putting them together which again the money models putting them all together some of the stuff I'll give you in continuity you can use a front and offer UPS offers you can use a front and offer I just place them in the places that I use them most commonly and I think that they were at least they have worked the best for me \\[...0.3s\\] so this is our lineup we're gonna start with the classic up sell we'll do the menu up sell the anchor up sell the roll over up sell I use \\[...0.4s\\] all of these I have made so much money on these up sells and if you follow what I layout you probably will too \\[...0.4s\\] and I will probably get more animated in these because I just love these so much \\[...0.4s\\] alright with that being said \\[...0.7s\\] the classic up cell \\[...1.7s\\] all right the classic up cell as usual \\[...0.4s\\] how I Learned it description examples important points here's my lovely visual thing for the classic up cell \\[...0.6s\\] how I Learned it here we go so uh I had a \\[...0.8s\\] mentorship what do you call it wasn't really a mentorship I was just getting paid and I took him as a mentor he didn't really care about me at all um but \\[...0.9s\\] at a fur code dealer \\[...0.4s\\] and he was a fourth generation furrier and I uh remember \\[...0.6s\\] watching how his son who is my friend that's how I got the job uh I'd be brushing furcoats \\[...0.4s\\] all summer in the Heaton warehouse uh \\[...0.4s\\] unbelievably mind melting stuff like boring beyond belief and the thing that I kept thinking was that every single one of these coats was$200 and he had 7,000 coats in his warehouse and I was like holy cow I was like that's$1.4 million that he's making just for storing coats for the summer I was like this is pretty sweet and I know what I was making and it was not$1.4 million \\[...0.4s\\] for storing these coats and so \\[...0.4s\\] the offer that they had to get people in was that they would get people to store their coats and they said if they stored them they would get free earmuffs free for earmuffs so people were like oh that's cool and so people would come in for the free earmuffs and then they would say uh we'll store and condition the coat for you and it costs 30 bucks \\[...0.4s\\] to uh store the muffs now they come in for free earmuffs but it's the summer so then they would basically hand them the earmuffs and then take the earmuffs back and then they'd say you don't want anything else do you \\[...0.7s\\] and so by saying you don't want anything else they would assume clothes the winter storage the conditioning and the earmuffs that went with the sale and so that is when I Learned \\[...0.4s\\] you can't have X without y and that is the fundamental basis of the classic upsell you don't want burgers without fries you don't want burgers without a Coke you don't want a fur coat without storing it you don't want a fur coat without conditioning it it'd be like taking a car not getting it service like you don't want X without y and so I Learned a couple of things one was the \\[...0.4s\\] structure of a classic upsell which is you don't wanna expel out why but tactically I Learned the no sale sale \\[...0.4s\\] alright and so the way that this works is basically people had been conditioned over the years to to say no to salesman and so when someone says you don't anything else most people just immediately say no and so what we wanna do is basically imply \\[...0.4s\\] that the else means in addition to the thing we just offered you and by doing that you get people to say yes by saying no and so these people who came in to store their coats agreed to storage conditioning and the free earmuffs which then got stored at a 30 dollar fee \\[...0.5s\\] for \\[...1.2s\\] saying no \\[...0.8s\\] they don't want anything else \\[...0.3s\\] so \\[...0.4s\\] the no sale sales what I ended up calling a different sale which may sound confusing but bear with me so if someone came to the gym and they said they ultimately they declined every service offering we had \\[...0.4s\\] right which sucks \\[...0.3s\\] you would then try and salvage some sort of goodwill or report cause this person walked in is basically walking back out which sucks \\[...0.4s\\] and so you say hey listen I will still wanna help you for six weeks and so why don't we \\[...0.7s\\] just do this as an at home program alright so I'll give you this thumb drive that has add home workouts that you can follow and then come in in a couple days \\[...0.4s\\] and we will give you nutrition consult on the house alright we just wanna help you out and hopefully maybe when things are a little less crazy or money's a little bit better you can come back and at least have nice things to say about us \\[...0.4s\\] and so a lot of people would say yes to that and so when they showed up to the next appointment which is intrusion consult \\[...0.5s\\] we would still close the same percentage of them as we did for normal customers but here's the cool thing \\[...0.6s\\] we actually close them in a higher average ticket and so the people who bought services \\[...0.4s\\] and then bought supplements average$200 a ticket people who didn't buy services and then bought supplements average$300 a ticket \\[...0.7s\\] and so to me my lesson from this was that we tried to solve their problem not in a way they wanted to solve it so they wanted to lose weight but they wanted to have a magic pill rather than work \\[...0.5s\\] and so we needed to have the magic pill available for that which in their mind would be supplements now obviously we always say hey you gotta make sure you gotta eat the food and all that stuff but people hear what they wanna hear and so the thing is is the magic behind this is that we turned no sales \\[...0.7s\\] into sales by just offering them something else \\[...0.5s\\] so Zinzi Scription \\[...0.4s\\] so what you do is you provide a service for free that you can monetize in other way so this works for one time services or even recurring services provided the recurring stream is high enough margins to pay for both different way of saying essentially I give you thing a for free in exchange for buying thing B or I give you thing a for free and I will encourage you to buy thing B or I give you a thing for free as long as you continue to use thing B any of those things so the earmuff thing he says I will give you these free earmuffs and I will encourage you to storage \\[...0.8s\\] that's what that was a classic up sell \\[...1.1s\\] so if we have a lemonade stand with our classic up so \\[...0.5s\\] we say we want to give you a free cup of lemonade option 1 might be do you want \\[...0.4s\\] lemonade ice cubes to make it cold without diluting it now of course you could give cold lemonade but then you wouldn't have an ice cube up cell \\[...0.9s\\] option two would be do you want a stainless steel to go container to keep it cold for you and will donate$1 to help children's cancer to anyone who takes the bug you also get 20% off refills \\[...0.6s\\] up so No 2 \\[...0.5s\\] right so you don't want lemonade in a little paper cup you want a nice steel mug you don't want diluted down lemonade you want \\[...0.4s\\] lemonade ice cubes right each of these things are just natural up cells that could happen and I prove this point because ever it is you sell there's an up sell that's available for you all right so storage \\[...1.0s\\] in this business um I have a whole story around this but \\[...0.4s\\] I tell this in the book so I'll give you the brief version of it but in the first few months of me being in business I was struggling a little bit and so the business owner across the street was a massive storage unit and he ended up becoming a member of my gym because it was super convenient for him and so he asked me you know hey how much time you got left to live and I was like not that long and so he said come for a ride with me and \\[...0.5s\\] he took me to his \\[...0.6s\\] facility and he said \\[...0.7s\\] how much does a free month of storage cost and I was like I don't know free and he was like no hundred twenty seven dollars and so as we walked in he asked Judy the front desk girl he said how much does a free month of storage cost she was like a hundred and seven dollars and he was like that's right \\[...0.4s\\] and so I was like how does this even work he's like okay so you come in for free month of storage he's like what's the first thing you're gonna need and he's walking me through the facility and pauses and I was like I don't know and he taps the lock on the door and I was like oh a lock and he's like right he's like you can't have any kind of lock because there's only one kind of lock that fits the store the locks that I saw at the front \\[...0.8s\\] it's like for$47 you know it's like oh okay got it and I was like so you make 47 people come from I was like but where's the other you know whatever it is 80 bucks \\[...0.5s\\] he's a good question he's like \\[...0.4s\\] now that you have your lock what else you're gonna need \\[...0.5s\\] I was like \\[...0.6s\\] you know I'm like I don't know he's like well you probably need some boxes for all that stuff that you have which I have convenient here you don't wanna go to another place down the street or have to order them on Amazon wait for them to come break them box them all this is like we have them right here available for you \\[...0.5s\\] and I was like oh right he's like and we also have a hand toe \\[...0.4s\\] uh the the hand trucks that you can use to move your stuff in and out at your convenience \\[...0.7s\\] for a fee as oh right he's like you know and this stuff probably really valuable for you cause otherwise you just throw it away but it's valuable enough that you pay to store it \\[...0.4s\\] uh we \\[...0.4s\\] obviously guarantee up to$500 damage uh that could happen if there's a flood or anything should happen or theft but if you want you can have a million dollar storage fee for just an extra$10 a month \\[...0.9s\\] and he paused he was like you wanna know my margins on that I was like \\[...0.6s\\] okay and he was like 90% \\[...1.3s\\] and so he explained that he's like and you know what happens a lot of times is that people's eyes are bigger than their stomach so they come here and they think they're gonna be able to fit all this crap in a locker this big \\[...0.5s\\] often times they need a bigger unit it's also a little bit space here and that way they can get their stuff in and out because they don't realize if stuff's in the back they gotta move everything out just to get to it and so he walked me through everything every single up sale that they had and I realized that's how a free month of storage created$127 and so many businesses right now just like the rent a car story just like the storage unit there are other things that a customer must purchase they will buy them it's just question will they buy them from you or somebody on the street so \\[...0.5s\\] weight loss so for us up sale No 1 was at the nutrition orientation we would sell the supplements we would then sell the nutrition plans that was and the immediate version for me was I wanted to sell supplements cause I had no more delivery I could immediately hand it to them make the profit back and usually what I made on the supplements covered the costal car customer so just that sale covered my my cash flow and I hadn't even started servicing them yet and so a lot of you guys have these little things that are available like if I was a physical therapist maybe you give four free treatments as your offer that's a banger offer a lot of people might consider that but up so one is you're gonna need these orthotics these bands these braces these oils this Canisio tape all to maximize the effectiveness of the four treatments and so they come in for the free month of storage but they need their lock they need their insurance they need their boxes just think about those things for yourself if you're in education it's like I offer \\[...0.4s\\] uh group coaching pride information in the community for free and definitely as long as you keep using my software by the way this is basically I mean fundamentally what we do with school we do all this stuff for free and then just use school to help monetize \\[...0.4s\\] okay uh freeverse discount note is that with the classic up cell \\[...0.5s\\] it works either way same as normal so a friend of mine had a very successful weight loss chain and they offered services for$5 a month \\[...0.4s\\] for their weight loss and they had doctors and nurses and all stuff there and I was like that's insane and she was like yeah cause we don't make money on the weight loss services \\[...0.4s\\] and I was like what do you mean she's like oh we sell like five granded supplements on the second day \\[...1.1s\\] I was like oh so that's why I Learned \\[...0.5s\\] that's why I really Learned a lot of the really Jedi stuff that I know from um supplement sales uh I Learned from her \\[...0.6s\\] and I paid her top salesperson \\[...0.5s\\] uh$500 an hour for two hours to tell me everything she did to sell supplements and you know what's crazy when I told her top salesperson that I would pay her$500 she was like \\[...0.6s\\]$500 she's like just to talk to you and I was like yeah \\[...0.7s\\] she thought I was an idiot \\[...1.1s\\] I'm I'm dead serious she \\[...0.6s\\] she looked at me like I had \\[...0.4s\\] three eyes on my head she was like it's your money \\[...0.7s\\] and so she just walked me through every single detail of what she did to sell supplements and that$1,000 two hours that I paid for made me millions \\[...1.0s\\] and so I highly encourage you \\[...0.5s\\] sometimes the best people learn from are people who aren't even selling information just offer to pay them to learn what they do in their particular nature skill and because people are not used to doing that and you can chart you know you could offer way more with the value you know with the with the money's worth to you \\[...0.6s\\] you can make way more money that way so uh I Learned from her that she had service that she basically gave for \\[...0.4s\\] a nominal amount of money cause she didn't care about it just because that drew people in and then they sell the supplements in the food and the bars and the shakes um \\[...0.8s\\] and yeah they were they you know they had doctors and nurses working there that's how they made the money \\[...0.6s\\] so \\[...0.4s\\] important points so No 1 if you make thing a free then you gotta be able to give it away for free if someone comes in and wants the free workouts you have to deliver the free workouts so \\[...0.4s\\] you can't say you have to buy this other thing otherwise it's not free you wanna strongly encourage the thing but that's fundamentally how it works alright so make sure that doesn't cost you a lot or anything at all like that thumb drive that we gave like \\[...0.4s\\] you can \\[...0.4s\\] you want it to be something that's cheap but still valuable \\[...0.6s\\] the next thing is make the up sales the next natural thing that they would need to buy that's the boxes the large units the locks the the insurance \\[...0.6s\\] things like that \\[...0.5s\\] the weight loss clinic continuity of service continuity of supplements done for you meals hormone treatments etc all of those things were all part of classic up cells that went through you can't have X with that y you can't have this weight loss service without these supplements just think you can't have X with that y as your as your mental framework for what the next thing I'm gonna offer is \\[...0.7s\\] alright this play works so well because the perception of how essential or required the next thing is alright so this is the key point if supplements is core to how someone's gonna get results with the main thing the likely they buy is very high so if you remember the minimum package for the rental car story I gave you you want this to feel \\[...0.7s\\] as required as possible again you don't wanna make it required because then it's it's \\[...0.5s\\] it gets shady \\[...0.4s\\] but you want you strongly encourage people to take these things to get the best results which ethically they should be able to get better results with whatever your upsell is \\[...0.5s\\] alright and so how seamless the upsell process is for the prospect if you make it frictionless you can get sometimes 80% plus of people to take these upsells I personally prefer to have up sales that have very little operational drag so that I can immediately offset cost to get it getting a customer \\[...0.4s\\] or it becomes that's my major profit stream it depends on what the objective is for your business boom \\[...0.4s\\] summary \\[...0.4s\\] works on the front end as a back end works as an internal play meaning you can just upsell your existing customers that's basically what the storage thing with with the fur coats was many of these people were existing customers you can just upsell those people \\[...0.4s\\] um if you suck at sales this is not a hard sale to make \\[...0.8s\\] uh there's a lot of good will in this play because you just make sure that you close the upset like it's like hey let me give you this thing I'm giving this free year buffs why not take it but of course you gotta take this other thing too \\[...0.4s\\] um and if you aren't getting 80% plus close rates you're doing it wrong so that's my big benchmark for you if you're getting 30% to take it you're not you're not making it assumed enough you're not \\[...0.5s\\] it's it's not clear enough to them that this goes with so think about like that it has to go with if you go to McDonald's I would bet you that 80% of people are getting fries and a Coke you want you want a very high uptake rate on the people buy the next natural thing think of this as the thing that goes with the thing and give the thing away for free to make sure that all the thing that goes with the thing you can make them honey on all right and said the nice thing with this is that it gives you a lot of upfront customers \\[...0.9s\\] and that is the classic up sale"

I have used this sales process in many businesses like this slays.All right, so you guys are Learned. So \\[...0.4s\\] this whole process took me, \\[...0.4s\\] call it years to learn every single piece of it, but every single part is like a Lego thing that builds onto itself.So the first thing that I, the first thing that I Learned \\[...0.4s\\] was, uh, well, tell you the story and you can go along with it. So I \\[...0.9s\\] had that guy who was making supplements and he was making 80 grand a month or whatever. And I was like, I gotta start selling supplements.And so I buy$5,000 of inventory and then of course, \\[...0.4s\\] no one buys my product. So I'm there, I've got these full shelves. I'm \\[...0.5s\\] reading all the stuff about retail and packaging and make sure they're twisted to the front, but no one's buying these things. And, um you know, the only sales I was getting were like pity sales.And I could tell the difference. They were like, this guy's so broke. Sure, I'll buy a protein from you, right? And so I would, I was getting all the signs. I was like hypertrophy and the body mist and, but, you know, creaching levels and what, like \\[...0.6s\\] mind you, I'm selling 70% women here. No one cared. And so I just went on a particularly bad day, I went over 19 on nutrition consult. So the way that I would do is I would sell services for 2, 3 weeks of time and then I'd schedule all my nutrition consults in one day. And so I just go back to back to back to, back to back.And so I went over 19, so I'm feeling horrible to myself and this lady comes in and she has a fat ring, an expensive purse. And I was like, if I don't close this woman, \\[...0.4s\\] I will kill myself. Not really, I will just continue to try, but I felt I was like, I have to close this lady.And so we get through the nutrition part and I'm so like beat down at this point that I was like, \\[...0.7s\\] hey, um, do you want vanilla or chocolate for your protein? And she just looked at me and she was like, which one do you like? And I was like, \\[...0.4s\\] chocolate. And she's like, okay, I'll take that.I was like, \\[...0.5s\\] and I slid across the counter and I was like, okay. And then I was like, dad, for pre workout, do you want kiwi or strawberry? And then I remember she'd ask me as I like kiwi. She's like, I'll take one of those. So I like put that and now I'm afraid that I didn't wanna scare her away.And so I remembered that she, because everybody had already bought stuff before. And I had all their contracts here, because if someone's payment didn't go through, I would meet them on the district council.Like, hey, your second payment to go through, let's make sure. That's so I had everybody's cards right there, and so I'd be like, oh, um, do you wanna use the card that ended in 46\\. 96? And she was like, yeah, that's fine.And so \\[...0.7s\\] I just slid them across the counter, she grabbed her tubs, she walked out the door, and I was like, holy shit, I know how to sell supplements. And the craziest thing in the world is that I didn't even talk about the products. I just asked what flavor she wanted. And so that was the first thing I Learned two things on that one experience.Number one was I Learned the a or B sale, the which one did you prefer? Sale was an assumed close. I closed everyone else the rest of the day. I close another like 12 appointments, whatever was, I close every single person rest of the day.I was so pumped and I closed. I Learned the card on file close, which was, oh, if you have someone's card on file, I didn't want her have to take her, take her wallet out or like think about the purchase again. I was like this card on file, just like, sure. And so it made it really easy for people to buy.So there's the two first things I Learned, the AB up sale and the Cardinal File closed \\[...0.4s\\] boom.That was the first thing that I Learned that became part of the mini close.The second thing I Learned and this is much later, so now I'm kind of a closing machine. I'm closing five to 10 thousand dollars a day when I would do my supplement sales days.Alright, so now I've got this lady comes in, I got my, I got back to back appointments, so I'll be taking \\[...0.4s\\] two appointments every 30 minutes. So I'll do 48 sales consults in one day. One on one or start out one on one, one on two, four per hour. And so I would go through these and so this, so I had to be on time.And so this lady comes in \\[...0.4s\\] and she will not stop asking me questions. She's like, well, what if I'm, what if I'm traveling, what if I don't have this with me? What if she's asking all the stuff and she's like, well, do I take this one at night, this one in the morning? And \\[...0.4s\\] I was like losing my mind.And so finally, I just turned her \\[...0.4s\\] meal plate over and I just wrote like, take two of these at this time, take two of this at this time, one of these at this time, blah blah, blah. And this was how much when, how many, what if it's working when home, at home, etc. Right? So I wrote to everything they had to do, and I went late.So now the next lady, and this was the tough part because the next lady had come in already, so she's sitting there waiting for me to finish with this, this chatterbox.And so the next lady comes up and I'm like, okay, I gotta get through this one quick so I can get back on schedule. And then she just says, hey, can you do what you did for that lady for me? \\[...1.0s\\] And I was like, \\[...0.8s\\] okay, great. But here's what happened.The first lady, I had gone through the pitch for every product, and then she'd ask all these questions. This lady, I just said, \\[...0.8s\\] shoot to get back on track. I just, I said, okay, you're gonna need two of these you need one of these, you need two of these.Great. And at the end \\[...0.7s\\] I said, caught on file, and she was like, yeah, that's fine. And then she bought everything and I was like, holy crap, I don't even.So \\[...0.4s\\] what I Learned was \\[...0.4s\\] detailed and personalized instruction explaining post purchase behavior, increase the likelihood that they buy more than vague and general instructions. So basically, this is how you're gonna use. This thing assumes the purchase.Why am I gonna spend the time to say you're gonna take two of these in the morning, one of these at night, and then the person's like, \\[...0.4s\\] oh, I'm not buying any of it. It'll feel like a tremendous waste of time for them.So again feeling that, like, it's assumed, it's part of the thing \\[...0.7s\\] required, no strongly recommended.Yes, and so that was the third tactic I Learned AB close, learn the card on file from the First Lady, and then this one I Learned about detailed prescription, so I call this the prescription close \\[...0.5s\\] the \\[...0.6s\\] third piece.That, that completed the four part puzzle that became the menu sale. And this is the most deadly of them. It's so good, \\[...0.4s\\] so \\[...1.0s\\] now I already told you about the seating thing earlier. That's like, it's, that's so savage, and it's still not good enough to make these four into what the menu closes.Right, so this one, so now this fast forward a little bit more. So now I'm a closing machine, I'm prescribing things, I'm getting everybody buy right.So now I'm on the road launching gyms, and so I would get good enough that I would, I would just sell out of everything I had, right? Basically whatever I had left, I'd be like, oh, yeah, you want kiwi and banana and, like, just whatever I had.I was like, these are the ones you're taking, so I could just sell all the stuff I had. And so, um, I sold out pretty early this day for a couple key products, and normally would have been fine, cause I would just like, \\[...0.6s\\] basically recommend different products, different flavors that I had run out of.But this lady, her friend had come at like 10 a. M. And she was coming at like 3, and so I'd already had like 20 more consults between the first lady and her friend. And her friend was just like, hey, just give me all the stuff you gave me, you gave Sandra. And I was like, uh okay uh, don't have that.So what I started doing, I said, okay, well, I don't have this cause I ran out. I was like, but you can get this from down the street. It's not gonna be as good, but it'll get you through the, through the program. And this one you can get from this store. This is the brand you want. It's not gonna be as good, but it'll get you through the thing.And so she was like, okay, thanks so much, I really appreciate it. But after telling her the two or three things that she could get from somebody else, \\[...0.4s\\] I then was like, but you're gonna want \\[...0.4s\\] two of these, which will take in the morning. One of these, would you take it this time? Great, you need to card, you have a file. And she was like, sure.And so what I realized was that I went out of my way to cross out what she didn't need, and this build enough goodwill to upsell what she did.And so what I realized later, also cause she just, it just went like water. I can like, I can tell, like, I have enough sales chops to be like, that was a little too easy.Like that was way easier than normal, and so I started keeping products \\[...0.5s\\] just to cross them out, and so I'll explain it like this. It's not that I would have products that we necessarily wouldn't sell.It was more that I had some products that you almost know I was gonna buy. I'm selling predominantly females, so I had weight gainer. Now if I had a guy who's trying to get bigger, then sure, but, like, that would be like one out of 100, and so four 99% of women that were coming in the door.I'd be like, well, you're not trying to gain weight, are you? They'd say no, and I'd cross out the weight gainer and then I'd be like, hey, well, you're not trying to get any chest air, get a deeper voice, anything like that.Be like, no, I'm like, alright, well, we're not gonna use the test booster, right? And so I would cross out two or three things on my menu and then I would say, great, you can do this now.I did have some options, for example fish oil \\[...0.4s\\] where I would say, listen, \\[...0.6s\\] I like, it was a low margin product. And so I would rather not make$3 on fish oil and make 40 on a fat burner and give the fish oil away to close 100% of people on the fat burner.And so that was how \\[...0.4s\\] I realized what I call \\[...0.6s\\] unselling, which is you start by telling them what they don't need so that they believe you when you tell them what they do need. And so that is what created the unsell prescribed, ask what they prefer, make it easier to pay menu close.So \\[...0.7s\\] you unsell by selling customers what they don't need, so that you can emphasize what they do.Here instead of asking if they wanna buy or not. You explain what they don't need as a way to get them excited about what they do. So unsells vary based on customer needs. When some options work best, you can cross out the rest, and that runs.So after telling them what they don't need, you then \\[...0.9s\\] prescribe what they do need.So all the unselling is the cross out, then we move to prescription. So in prescription, we tell them what they do need. Prescription upsells work well when offering a choice is inconvenient, and you've only one thing that solves the problems. If you've only one thing, it's like, you're only taking this fat burner, there's no flavors for the fat burner, so you just say this is how many you need to take at this time. Prescription of selling has two important components.First, you have to explain how it integrates with the offers they already bought. So they already bought service. This is gonna integrate with how you use our weight loss services or workouts or whatever.Second, you personalize in detail how to maximize its value for them. So here instead of asking if they wanna buy it or not, you explain how to use it \\[...0.7s\\] as if they already have bought it \\[...0.4s\\] again, we remove the option of not buying to lower the chance that they don't buy.As, uh, and, and I once, uh, and once I've told them exactly \\[...0.4s\\] how they're going to use everything, \\[...0.6s\\] we then ask them if they prefer a or B, \\[...0.5s\\] so we say, okay, what are your preferences?The AB up cells work for multiple offers that solve the same problem. Alright, so you make AB upsells by asking preference. Instead of asking if customers want to buy a product, yes or no, we ask which one they prefer, a or B, so either choice results in an upsell.So basically, when you give people the option not to buy, some people don't buy. So I give the option to pick between two buying options that are simpler. And once they know which one they're buying and how they're gonna use it.I suggest the easiest way for them to pay \\[...0.6s\\] boom. We give the card on file close, which is the cherry on top of this up cell sweetness.Alright, so I literally ask, do you wanna use the card on file just like that? So here instead of asking if they wanna pay or not, we refer to ways they have already paid in the past, and this gets more people to buy because it lowers the hidden costs of buying, picking out which card you wanna use, taking it out being reminded of ugly buying decisions in the past.Cause a lot of times some people, like, there is a minor decision that goes when you say yes.And then there's a second yes when you reach in your pocket, and then you're looking at your card, and then you grab the, like, there's a, there's another decision that happens.We avoid that entire decision making process by just saying when he's a card on file, yes, and we remove the pain associated with making the decision, so even the hassle of buying stuff in a rush.So sometimes I'd have people who are passing it, they're like, hey, I gotta get to the city, like caught on file. And they're like, yeah, yeah, it's fine. And so if I, if I weren't able to do that close, they'd be like, uh, I'll pick them up later and I'll come back, and that would lose the sale. And so it's also the fastest way to close, and that is how that works. So let me give you some examples, \\[...0.4s\\] and these are fire as fuck, haha.Alright, \\[...0.4s\\] so \\[...0.6s\\] if I'm a massage therapist, I would unsell, \\[...0.5s\\] I would say, hey, we have a lymphatic massage available, but I don't think you're pregnant, are just out of surgery, right?So we can cross that out, fantastic. So then we'd prescribe, so since your shoulder hurts, will heat you up first. Then we'll hit you trigger points, then after that, we'll do some dynamic stretches, so that's a prescription \\[...0.8s\\] now we say, so would you rather do a before work or on the way home?Then great, you wanna use a card on file done. If you're like, I can't AB, \\[...0.4s\\] you can absolutely AB anything, and I'll show you how to do in a second.Alright, so give another example dog food, so, uh, you're not gonna need a small bag of puppy stuff, you've got a big dog, so you don't need these vitamins either, because we've got that in the food already. So you don't even worry about that. They're like, oh wow, so nice this guy.It's already covered inside of the food that I'm buying. Then we say so, but what you're wanna gonna do is give your dog one of these joint shoes at each meal.Alright, in every 90 days, you give them one of these wafers for Hardworks, also make sure to bring him in back next month, and we can get that books right now. Does your dog prefer chicken or beef flavor?Great, when you use the cards, you have a file \\[...0.4s\\] dot digital products, so, uh, listen, you don't need all 8 courses yet, you just need to solve X, y and Z so I tell you what I'll send you some free stuff that solves X and y, and you'll just need one course to cover problem Z, but to solve Z, you're definitely gonna do the course in this particular way.Can you put an hour to date towards it? Okay, great, so this will prevent any other Z problems from cropping up later a or B, so would you rather have direct message or phone support? Okay, great, and would you rather start today or Monday?Got it, alright, awesome, usually card you have in file \\[...0.5s\\] done, so you can use that 4 step process with anything.Now important points, anything is air be sellable. Do you wanna start on Monday or Tuesday? Do you wanna have John or Emi as your, as your person? Do you wanna do your workouts in the morning or the evening? Do you want paper or plastic, black or white cherry or strawberry?It doesn't matter whatever it is, if you have one thing you can think about particular features that vary within the bistro phone support and chat support. It does not matter. You could always make something air be sellable so that you can have a preferential close.If you make an air be offer, I recommend adding a nudge. So that was when the lady said which one do you prefer, so this is where you say I like strawberry.A lot of people like Amy, \\[...0.4s\\] John's really good with high schoolers, right, so you make a nudge based on the customer's needs, so, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, do you want chicken or beef? A lot of the big dogs like beef \\[...0.6s\\] done.It's just like, you know, you wanna present, so this is what happens. We present the illusion of choice, and then we remove the friction of choice by nudging this one. So they have the illusion.Yes, I'm buying something, but then we do this and they're like, great, I have to think about that sounds great. If you go to a restaurant and you're like, hey, \\[...0.4s\\] uh, do you want, uh, flambe or do you want creme brulee?And you're like, they're like, most people get the creme brulee or we get a lot of great reviews of the creme brulee. People always come back for the creme brulee.If you say that right after making the choice, we know I got the illusion, but then this is the one that they want me to buy, which might have three times the margin.Now if you sell out, this is a pro tip for me, two things. One is if you sell out of something, you can then just nudge stuff that you're lower on inventory.So if you've got three bottles of this and 25 bottles of that, just nudge differently. Now if you sell out completely, this is something I Learned later. If it's physical products, um, or if you're at capacity for your service, take payment and deliver late. Mean not liver late in terms of expectations, but deliver at a delay.And I found out that people cared way less about it being a delay and care way more about missing expectations. And so if I said, \\[...0.5s\\] hey, \\[...0.5s\\] I'm gonna take this order for you so you get exactly what you need, you're gonna get in the mail in 7 days, they were fine with it. I thought that if they didn't walk out that no one would buy.Not the case at all. People are totally fine buying. If I set the acquisition. If I said they're gonna come in seven and they came in 10, they hated me. If I said seven, they came in four. They were happy.And so if you have a service thing and you say, hey, you're on the phone, you know, you can only take seven people a week, and you already have eight sold, then you're like, shoot, I can't take this guy home, but I don't wanna miss the sale, take the deposit, start them in 14 days \\[...0.8s\\] now.This is something that I Learned later because I had to teach my staff this process, and so what I found out was that employees love unselling, because, it's like, it's you, cause you feel good, right, so you're talking the prospect, and cause everybody basically, it's like, here are your homie hookups.Everybody wants to hook up a customer cause then they get a little authority, little power, they get report the customer, all those things.And so you say, hey, I'm gonna help you get a homie hookup by design, so these are the three things you can cross out, and you, these are the two products you can tell them to buy down the street.And now once an employee doing it, it actually gets even more powerful because if it's the owner doing it, then they're like, huh, if an employee does it, it's very common for employees to not have the best interest of the business at heart.And so we lean into that bias that most people know of that they're like, hey, don't tell the boss.But now when they're saying, don't tell the boss, but you do need these ones. The whole time it's scripted \\[...0.4s\\] if you have two options, so this is what happens. You like, okay, what if I have two options, but I want people to buy both?All right. So the way we think about this, so there's the economist that made this amazing case study on this.So they had their print stuff and they wanted to offer a digital offering of the economist, the subscription, that was the most profitable people they could, they could basically make more gross profit on print \\[...0.4s\\] relative to the price.So they could charge more for relative the cost than they could on digital, cause people's perception of digital is lower in terms of value, thinking people would buy both.The economy was offered the following, so they said$59 a year for the digital subscription and one 25 per year for digital plus prep.They figured everyone would take that offer, \\[...0.4s\\] but everyone just took the 59 dollar year digital and said don't need the print anymore. So their print sales plummeted, and as a result, they made way less money \\[...0.6s\\] bad for them. So this is what they did to fix it. They added a decoy option in the middle. \\[...1.3s\\]Now the numbers here is just so that you can think about whatever you want in terms of relative price.But the actual thing that they did was they had a$59 per year digital, the one 25 per year digital plus print, but this is the decoy. They added \\[...0.6s\\] a print only for 1:00: 25 a year, meaning they took their best offer and just cut it in half, but kept the price the same. And so now if you pay 1.25 for either of these things. Now you're like, well, you know what? I just basically get the digital for free here, whereas here I have to pay for it. So now this feels like the better deal and then they fix the sales and then way more people took option C so simply by adding the middle option they got more people to take both.And so right now if you have two things and you're like, well, how do I get them to buy both, add the third offer \\[...0.6s\\] that's the same prices both with only one bottom line is that you present three options, option A, option B, and option C, which is a and B, \\[...0.4s\\] and you make the price of C, a and B the same as the more expensive between a or B all right, so long as you price the three options, preserve your margins, you make customers choice easy, and then you sell both before people take this, after more people take that.So \\[...0.9s\\] money upsells work best when you have multiple offers available. Many upsells combine four tactics, unselling, prescribing AB offer and the card on file, close, unselling lower marginstuff where appropriate incentivizes higher margin upsells, \\[...0.6s\\] encourage employees to unsell and game the system on purpose by design, nudge new customers towards the thing that makes sense for them, or the thing that you have the highest margins, or the thing that you're running out of, or that you're not running out of in terms of directing their buying decisions. That is the menu up sell. \\[...1.8s\\]So we just covered menu up sell, which is one of my favorite up sells ever. The anchor up so is one that is so powerful. It's one of those, like, very simple ones that can make you a tremendous amount of money. And so what the menu up so has in elegance, the anchor up so has in brute force.So let's dive in. Here's how I Learned it, description examples in porn points same as before. Let's rock and roll.So I had spent five years plus in casual clothes sweating a tank top \\[...0.4s\\] as a gym owner. Like, the nicest thing I ever wore \\[...0.4s\\] was a tank top, \\[...0.7s\\] and so when I started gym watch, um, somebody \\[...0.5s\\] that I knew advised me to look professional.He said, listen, no one's gonna listen to you for business stuff if you look like just a gym rat. And so I said, okay, I'll listen to you, and so he said, don't worry, I've got a guy at a suit shop, \\[...0.4s\\] um, that I know, and he'll hook you up.And he told the owner I was coming, so I mentally budgeted 500 bucks for a suit. So I was like, this is a lot of money, so, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ball out for this.So I ended the shop, \\[...0.4s\\] made some small talk, and he was like, so what do you want? I was like, I want a boss suit. He was like, okay, mind you, I'm like, 26, whatever. And so I tried, you know, so he gives me the suit I tried on, I felt cool. He's like, how you feel?I was like, I feel like, feel like a boss, and he's probably laughing at himself. So anyways, I'm looking at stuff in the mirror, and so then I, like, kind of look down at the tag that's on the arm. And when I pull it over, it says$16,000.And I still can remember \\[...0.4s\\] the blood just draining from my face, being like, \\[...0.6s\\] there are 16 grand. I was like, that's a car, hahaha. And I was like, oh god, like, what did I get? Cause my friend had referred me. So I was like, I don't look like a fool here. And that, you know, they had prepped the stuff.So \\[...0.5s\\] the sales guy who is the owner, he was also a third generation tailor, obviously not his first Rodeo.I looked at the, I was like, hey, he's like, \\[...0.4s\\] he could see that I was a little, uh, distraught from the price. He's like, hey, do you care much about the, uh, the, the, the brand of the suit? And I was like, oh no, I don't care, I just wanted to look cool. And he was like, oh, don't worry.So he had already prepared and this is key, \\[...0.5s\\] other shoots next to me. And so he took this one off. He says, hey, try this on for size. And just like, immediately.So at this one is like, how does this one look? And I'm like, great. Like, I didn't even want, I was like, I didn't want to, like, I think about potentially having the suit.So I then pulled over and says, two grand. And I'm like, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, like, it's more than I wanted, but like, I, like, at least this is not a car. Like I can get out of here, you know, without embarrassing myself. And so \\[...0.4s\\] he's like, you like it?I said, sure. I ended up buying like$500 in like, shirts and socks that went with the suit \\[...0.5s\\] and spent I think 25 bucks or three grand, something like that \\[...0.6s\\] on the way out the door.As I went through the process later, I thought to myself I came in with a 500 dollar budget and I ended up spending five or six times my budget. And I was like, how did that happen?And I realized that \\[...0.4s\\] the first thing I saw was 16,000 dollars, and it just made everything seem like nothing. And so, uh, Roy Sutherland actually tells a story about this with Rolls Royce.So Rolls Royce stop showing their cars at car shows, because if you have all these different cars and then you see a 400,000 R car, it seems egregious. And so what they started doing was showing their Rolls Royces at, uh, plain and yacht shows.So if you just decided not to buy a 50 million dollar jet, \\[...0.4s\\] a 400,000 dollar car feels like candy on the way out the door. And so everything is relative in terms of what the price is being positioned against. And so I was like, man, that was really powerful and it changed how I saw sales. \\[...1.2s\\]And so that is what happens. I spent five times more than my original budget and ended up spending 300 dollars on accessories and shirts, which I never normally would have spent. But it felt like nothing compared to the, the new 22 dollar shoot or whatever that I bought. So that is how I Learned the anchor up sale.Now here's how it works. So anchor up sales involve offering premium items first, \\[...0.6s\\] key \\[...0.5s\\] first. If the customer is shocked by the price, you offer a cheaper alternative \\[...0.7s\\] by changing secondary features.This is what's key about this, so presenting a premium version first at five to 10 times the price makes the other offer, our main offer, the one that we sell to most people look like a better deal.And so this strategy leads to more people buying the main offer. And so it works best when the lower priced offer has the same core functions as the premium one. It has the same primary features, so the second 22 hour shoot still look good. It still felt good.It still had a good, you know, trim or whatever. It looked expensive, but it just wasn't Armani or whatever else, whatever other brand he had.And so for me, the secondary feature of the brand mattered very little, cause I was like, no one's gonna ask me for the brand of suit I'm wearing. They just wanna, I need it to look cool, \\[...0.4s\\] right? And so the thing is, is that every offer, every product has primary features and secondary features.You want the secondary features to be different between your really expensive one and your minor one. But if it's just a little bit different, and it's 1/8 the price, people are like, oh, this is a steal now.Because what we showed them first in the suit example, 22 dollar shoots seem like a better deal committed 16 thousand dollar. One, two additional benefits of anchor up sales that happened as a result.Number one is that customers tend to spend more than the initially planned. I spent five times what I was going to spend. Two, some customers will still opt for the expensive option. He probably has done that with a lot of guys, and maybe one out of five guys buys 16,000 our suit and guess what happens? We take a 16,000 our suit and divided by five that adds$3,000 to every average purchase. So my 2,000 our shoot actually becomes a 5,000 our shoot.In terms of economics, the business, so even if one out of five or one out of 10 \\[...0.6s\\] people buy something 10 times expensive, if you have one out of 10 buy something 10 times expensive, you double your business, \\[...1.5s\\] not to mention the increased uptake rates in average spend of all the other customers.So like I said, the menu up, so we talked about earlier, very elegant, very savage, really good for high volume transaction businesses.This one \\[...0.4s\\] a fucking ram rod for businesses that spend, that have fewer customers, that spend lots of money. Basically, this can still make you more money than the menu up sale can, even though it's just very simple to understand.So here are the steps to using a crop cell. You present the anchor, the really expensive thing. Step 1, \\[...0.4s\\] step 2, get the gasp. Alright, expect customers to freak out about the cost that's expected if you didn't do it, you didn't anchor high enough. That's why I say \\[...0.4s\\] 10 times the price.So if you're like, I don't know, it's just an anchor, like, I, I added 20%. It's not an anchor. It has to be an order of magnitude larger.It has to be so much larger that it gets you to re categorize your original purchase. It had, like, think about it buying planes and buying yachts compared to playing a car. Totally different manager.It can't be, you know, it can't be within 100%. It's gotta be 5 x 10 x more. Once you get the gasp, you come to the rescue. You ask if they care about what makes it premium, those secondary features. Do you care about the, the material or the internal lining stuff that somebody that most people won't care about?Then you present your main offer, and you expect the customer feel relieved and see the better deal. Then you just ask how they wanna pay which card you prefer. So here's some pro tips.Number one is the only thing worse than making a thousand dollar offer to a person with a hundred dollar budget, is making a one hundred dollar offer to someone with a thousand dollar budget.In the first situation, you lose a hundred dollars, in the second situation, you lose 900\\. I've lost tons of customers and mountains of cash because customers wanted more than I had to offer.Boo, so now I always have premium up sales ready, anchors only a handful of customers buy them, but that handful of customers bring in \\[...0.5s\\] big profits, so always have premium offers even if most people don't buy them, you're not failing.If one out of 10 people buy it 10 times more expensive offer, you still double your business. Remember, you're not losing customers by offering premium stuff first, but you will lose money if you don't. Alright, let's do some examples.First one will do a local lawn care service, so the premium maker is get my cell phone number, Fancy Mulch Natural Pest Control bi weekly yard maintenance for$1,000 a week.Crazy \\[...0.4s\\] big shock, no worries, get my, my foreman's number, my, my team, my crew chiefs number. Generic mulch normal pest control biweekly yard maintenance for$200 a week. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do that one, I'll do that one cause it's almost the same thing at the end of the day.It's like, and they're probably like is this is my, you know you're gonna look any different. It's like, not really, just really depends on how much you care about the, the quality of the soil.Now for the guy who cares about the quality of the soil, he's gonna buy this thing. But for everybody else, which 80% of people don't give a rat's poo about \\[...0.4s\\] the quality of this other stuff, they're like, no, I'll take the 200.But they don't know that you couldn't price this at 200, because last week when you offered 200 straight up, people nickelindying you down a 1\\. 50 or 99 a week. So physical product, a painting, the anchor would be the super productive packaging, a 20 year insurance and gift wrap for$1,000.The main offer is normal packaging and one ear insurance and a sticker for 200 bucks. You're like, uh, I'll take the normal one.The thing is, is that you want the customer to feel reasonable by making the purchase. Like they're getting a better deal, like they're pulling one over on you. They're like, this guy thinks I want a thousand.Like he doesn't even know that this is basically the same thing. And it's like one fit the price, \\[...0.5s\\] but you designed the game, they are just playing it.Third is a Digital Product Associates, a newsletter. So the premium anchor would be like, hey, all previous issues and new issues and 24 hour early access to my newsletters for 1.99 a month or \\[...0.4s\\] new issues only. And you just get it on time for$19 a month. You're like, \\[...0.6s\\] oh yeah, I'll do the, I'll do the I mean, you know it'd be cool to get the 24 hours early, but like I'll just take the new ones. Like that's fine.And it's one tenth the price. And so now this feels like an absolute steal, but you might have been competing against people at$7 a month before that.All right, here's some important points about this. This is crucial. You will fail at doing an anchor up sale if you do not treat it seriously. So if you treat the anchor like a fake, so will the customer.If the guy had put it on my shoulders, I mean, like, it's probably out of your \\[...0.4s\\] range or sit well, that would be a little insulting.But if he's like, hey, if this isn't, you know, in your range, like no big deal, then I would have been anchored, cause I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have considered the purchase you have to have them fully consider the purchase, really trying to think, oh god, how would I come up with this? And what?Here's what happens is that your brain or their brain starts justifying why it might be worth that amount of money. And then when you offer something one tenth the price, they've already done all the heavy lifting of, of anchoring, \\[...0.4s\\] of comparing why it might be worth that.And then compared to this price, it's totally worth it. And that's all we change as little as we can from the thing that they thought about to the thing that they ultimately buy.Next point, \\[...0.4s\\] make a premium offer that you actually want people to buy. If you have this premium offer that has all these bells and whistles, be ready to service it.Because let me tell you the real secret of what ends up happening when people do this. They 10 x their price, they make this really bang, whiz bang thing \\[...0.5s\\] and then more than one out of people, 10 people buy it.And so this is just also a great way to give yourself permission to anchor something 10 times expensive. A proper anchor gets the gasp, expect them \\[...0.6s\\] design for them.You want the gas, the gas means they considered it. If they do not gas, but either means you didn't go high enough or you didn't sell hard enough, as in you didn't truthfully commit to actually selling that thing. Like you have to in earnest present it, or this will not work. It'll just be a waste of your time and theirs.And this is especially for business owners. If you teach your team this process, many of them will just skirt through the anchor because they start selling from their wallet.They're gonna be like, I would never pay for this. It's like, of course you wouldn't you already know how to fix cars, this guy does it. \\[...1.1s\\] And so we often \\[...0.8s\\] can never see the value of the stuff we sell because for us, it's easy. Duh, that's why we have a business around it. You wanna sell stuff that's easy for you and hard for other people. That's how you make money.Once you get the gasp, you come to the rescue. And if they don't bark, like, if they, if they don't gasp close the whale. If they're like, you know, this is a nice suit, \\[...0.5s\\] then you're like, great. Do you have a card on file?Do you wanna, you put a pair this with a handkerchief? You just move right on in the sale \\[...0.4s\\] and you're like, oh god, I got a whale on the line. I'm just gonna keep going to get more people to buy your main offer, make it a better deal.So this is the primary of our secondary features. You want it to be as little different from the main one, from the anchor \\[...0.6s\\] as, uh, as possible so that they justified the price already at this 10 times higher price.And when they hear this one, they're like, oh, this is a steal. Because if you make your good one too different \\[...0.4s\\] from the \\[...0.4s\\] core offer that you're also trying to sell, 80% of people \\[...0.8s\\] then they actually have to reconsider the offer again, they have to recalibrate price devalue.You want them to basically be able to take the same price devalue measurement they did here and then here an 80% discount or 90% discount. Because the things that you change were not the things they cared about.But if you all of a sudden have all these things they do care about, then you change primary features, not secondary features. So \\[...0.5s\\] if you present a more expensive offer first before a less expensive offer, more people buy less expensive offer than they would have on its own.When you present the anchor get the gasp come to the rescue, present the core offer, Astro payment for the most effective anchor. Make your premium offer 5 to 10 times more expensive.Anchor customer spend a bit more than they plan to, and don't treat an anchor like a fake, or the customer will too, and you will lose trust and waste their time.Important, some customers will buy premium offer. That is where you make way more money on this, because one, more people buy the main thing, and some people buy the very expensive thing. The expensive premium offer adds outsize profits with fewer sales.So just because you don't sell the most of it doesn't mean you don't make the most profit from it. The main offer and premium offer should have the same primary features. The premium offer has different secondary aka premium features after anchoring.Offering the primary features for 1/3 or 1/5 or 1/10 the price makes the main offer a great deal. It gives them basically the same thing for way less. That is the anchor up sale. \\[...0.3s\\]"

    "content": "\\[...2.0s\\]Alright, so we just crushed the classic upsell, the menu upsell, the anchor upsell. Now let's talk about the roll over upsell. Roll over upsell of these four upsells is probably my most used upsell, not necessarily my favorite, but my most commonly used.So let's break down how this came to be. So I Learned this from when I was doing the win your money back as the attraction offer. So everyone kept crediting their money towards the membership, but I would put it all up front, right? The membership was for me \\[...0.6s\\]$150 a month. So 600 bucks was four months of free service.So, you know, they did six weeks and then they would essentially get another four months for free. And it would almost take me a half year \\[...0.3s\\] to get my like first payment from people coming in the door, which was, which sucked, right?So the thing is for them, they didn't feel the payment, so they stopped coming. And so I needed a way to upsell people into something paid. And so I drove to a friend of mines actually here in Vegas now, uh, to learn more about how he ran his job \\[...0.5s\\] and, and things I studied everything he was doing, cause he was just doing way better than I was.And, uh, he said in this authentic comment that he was getting 70% plus people stay on afterwards and pay. And I was like, \\[...0.6s\\] how are you doing that? He's like, oh, yeah, he's gonna take their winnings and credit towards a year. And he said it just like that, and I was like, \\[...0.7s\\] that's it.All you do is you take whatever they just paid for, \\[...0.4s\\] and you roll it, and so that's the up sale. It's whatever you paid for, I'll just credit it towards the next thing.So \\[...0.4s\\] let's get into the description, here's how it works, so roll over up sales, credit some or all of a customer's previous purchase towards your next offer. And this in my experience gets \\[...0.4s\\] way more people to take it. So once I know how much credit to give, I figure out three things: \\[...0.3s\\] 1\\. Who to upsell, 2\\. What to upsell, and 3\\. How to roll over the credit? So for the who I use roller rub cells in four situations.First is to reengage customers who left a while ago. I call this a winback campaign. You reach out to old customers and say, hey, Sandra, you have been, you haven't been back in six months, but I saw that I owed you some money.And so the subject would be, I owe you money. And people tend to respond that, and so you say, hey, I owe you 500 bucks. And she's like, what do you mean, \\[...0.8s\\] you know, you owe me$500? Just like, well, I promise you this thing and, \\[...0.3s\\] you know, you haven't come back in a while, so I wanna take \\[...0.3s\\]$500 \\[...0.3s\\] now. That could be 100% of what they paid, it could be a third of what they paid so far, whatever.And say, and I wanna, I wanna get you in here and I'll credit towards, uh, this other service thing, right? And so a lot of people will take that offer to credit whatever they paid up to this point for more help.Great. And that's what, how you can reengage old pup, old people who haven't been back in a while.The second \\[...0.4s\\] is to rescue upset customers as a better alternative to a refund. So someone says, hey, I hate you. And you say, hey, no big deal. This$500 that you paid, I'll just credit towards the thing I should have sold you originally.So you got all the stuff that you just got for free. It's on me. Let's just give you the thing you really need. So I'd rather do a redo than a refund. And that's how we use the roll over there.The third is to rescue other people's upset customers. This is particularly savage. So what you do is you go down the one star reviews of all your competitors, and you message those people and you say, hey, how much money did you spend at so and so competitor, and they're, like, 12 dollars, fuck that guy.And you're like, you know what? I'll give you the 12 dollars of credit towards my stuff, because I just want you to get this problem solved.You turn their biggest hater into your biggest ambassador \\[...0.8s\\] savage \\[...0.5s\\] No. 4, \\[...0.5s\\] you upsell your regular customers walk in the door, so there's the four hoods, \\[...0.6s\\] the next one is the what, so remember, you can upsell more of what they just got something better or something new and or different. So to make money, roll their credit over to something more expensive.And so the more expensive thing again, in my opinion, should be five times more expensive.So if I'm gonna roll a 500 dollar thing, I wanna roll it towards a 2000\\. 25 dollars plus type offer \\[...1.0s\\] for the how you can apply all or part of the discount upfront, or you can spread it over time, and so this is dependent on you.So in the examples I get before I took it and I spread it over time, you could if you had a small amount, do it up front. It's up to you. You can also make up a fee that you can then wave and use the credit for.There's lots of things you can do here, alright, but fundamentally you can just figure out now the all or part of it is, like, let's say somebody \\[...0.5s\\] was with you for three years and they spent five grand with you.You might not credit five grand towards something else if your services, \\[...0.3s\\] you know, \\[...0.3s\\] aren't that much. Maybe it's$2,000 a year, 5,000 or three years of service.Well, you'd certainly wanna get that customer back, but if you give them another three years, it doesn't make sense. So you can say, hey, I'm gonna give you the last, you know, the last three things you bought for me, let me credit those instead. Right?You wouldn't say, instead, you say I'll credit those for you, \\[...0.3s\\] right. All of those things you can say, listen, I'm gonna assume that we did something to mess up because you didn't come back, and so I'm gonna assume that the last six months of service that we did was not up to snuff.So let me make it up to you, \\[...0.6s\\] so examples, so chiropractor re engage old patients with the win back campaign. So you say who's the, who? 6 months since their last purchase, what \\[...0.4s\\] new plan, how up front?So that's our who, our what or how, so reach out to your old patients, you look at their purchase history, you offer to apply \\[...0.3s\\] some or all their past purchase towards something more expensive than what they bought.So I would say, \\[...0.4s\\] hey, Mrs Banks, I wanted to give your money back, do you have a minute?Great, yeah, I wanted to see how your back pains going. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, I've got some good news as a way saying thank you. I want to give you$500 your money back is credit towards staying pain free for good. Is that of any interest? Great, let's get you in. Let's say dentist a save your own upset customer with a roll of rubsolve, so who upset customer, what?Teeth whitening, how front load 200 dollar credit. So you say, hey, the person pays 200 bucks for teeth cleaning but doesn't think their teeth got whiter. We explain they need more, \\[...0.3s\\] you know, to get more and upsell into each teeth whitening package, which includes multiple sessions and add home kit and multiple teeth cleanings.Then you offer to credit the$200 they just paid for the cleaning towards the whitening package. This just really works. If people were like, well, this isn't what I thought it was gonna be, and you're like, oh, that's on me.I thought you wanted this miscommunication, I'll make it up to you. Let me take everything you paid, so you didn't lose anything. Everything I was for free now, and let's put it towards the thing you ultimately wanted, cause the thing is they still want the thing they, \\[...0.3s\\] they spent money on.And so if what they really wanted was higher expectations, then sell them the higher baggage, \\[...0.4s\\] rescue cough, steal other people's upset customers, so who competitors customers, what service agreement, how rollover cost to break old agreement.So let's say you find a competitors upset customers and credit their old purchase with them towards a new purchase with you. Then you roll over the amount they owe them as a credit towards a longer agreement of you.So let's say they're like, ah you know, I would, but I've got three months left in this service agreement. You say, no worries, \\[...0.6s\\] whatever you have the three months, I'll credit it towards mine, and I'll just make mine a two year agreement.So you say, like, hey, John, saw your negative view on, uh, their product and it really upset me to make it up to you, I'll credit whatever payments you have left with them to switch to ours. This way you don't lose a thing and you start getting the benefits now.Fair enough, \\[...0.6s\\] cause that we don't have to wait for that thing to expire and pay and then wait to get the benefits. You can start getting benefits now and you don't lose anything and I get the customer membership.So this is where you spread the first purchase over time. So who current customers what? 12 membership how spread over the first purchase, \\[...0.6s\\] so somebody comes in buys a block of service \\[...0.8s\\] or a membership time, as soon as they do, you can then offer to apply the entire amount towards more time like 12 months.I can do roll over upsells anytime, I just prefer to do them right then. Alright, so this is the important voice, uh, use rollover, uh, offers to attract new customers. For example, \\[...0.4s\\] you roll over some or all of the customers paid somebody else towards your thing, and you can find leads by scraping contact information from negative product reviews wherever available.You can do roll over up sales before refunding. This has solved me tons of, save me tons of customers in cash if you did a bad job. Hey, it happens roll over for a do over, \\[...0.5s\\] and if they want something different, you can roll over the purchase toward that thing instead.Previous customer, uh, are still customers, upsell them, these are winbacks, so reach out to old customers 6+ \\[...0.4s\\] plus months, uh, from their last purchase, look how much they paid, decide how much you wanna give them, offer it.Example, I made personalized videos, this is me personally, I made personalized videos for 200 past customers.This is before AI and all that stuff, it took me like two days, \\[...0.6s\\] um, offering them$4,000 a credit to return, add urgency to rollover upsells, so make them one time only, so this is a key point, so this is optional, it's up to you, but this is how I prefer to do it.Make the moment you present the offer the only time to take the offer, so they don't get to sleep on it. So you wanna surprise and delight them with this credit of this discount.So if they want the credit, they got a ticket now. If not, no big deal, they can always pay full price later. How to price a roll over Upsale?So to make money on a discounted offer, you have to have profit left over in order to discount it, right, so I try to make the Upsale at least four times more than the roll over credit, so that gives me a 25% discount at most.If it's four times more expensive, remember the rules of discounting applied. Bigger discounts make you less profit, but per sale, but they get you more sales. Now \\[...0.4s\\] you don't need to credit the entire amount.I just like to highlight this again because people do this and then they ruin their businesses. I'm telling you don't do that. Like, you can just take as much or as little as you want.The goal is to simply get as much of a discount that you get responses. So if you find out that$200 is enough to move the needle and the average person spent$2,000 a year, then you can say, hey, your last purchase \\[...0.4s\\] with me of the 2,000 spent last year was this thing. And that's what you choose to credit.You don't have to credit everything. If you have small, if, if the person spend a very small time with you and you have really big packages, credit the whole thing. If they spend a really long time with you and you have small tickets, credit the last one.So I roll over whatever I think would incentivize to buy the next thing, and you can just test to find the sweet spot from the beginning. It's$500. You can test 300.This is my famous gift card play the way that this works, and this is a savage play, and it basically is a rollover, just like package differently \\[...0.5s\\] is that you say, hey, this works for, like, holiday seasons things like that.Say hey, this also crushes your Black Friday. I'm giving 200 dollar gift cards away \\[...0.5s\\] for 90% off \\[...1.0s\\] limit to per person, \\[...0.6s\\] and you can only use them on someone else, cause it's the holiday season. So you can do this for Christmas, and you can do this for Black Fridays, you can use it twice if you want.Now the key here, \\[...0.4s\\] you can also do for, uh, birthdays, \\[...0.6s\\] uh, sorry, not birthday, sorry, they give it to other people's birthday gifts.Anyways, \\[...1.5s\\] when customers buy the gift card, ask them who they want to make it out to, and if they'll make an introduction, then when that person comes in, the person introduced comes in, you roll their gift card over into the main offer.And so some people see this, and they're like, you want me to give 90% off my main stuff? It's like, no, bro, I want you to sell 2 thousand dollar thing and give 200 dollar gift cards away for 20 bucks.So what's really happening here? You're gonna get paid \\[...0.5s\\]$20 to get a lead, that's a hot referral that you're then gonna take the 200 dollars and roll it into a two thousand dollar product, which you may have marked up by 200 dollars. Or you add something to it.That's high margin that you can justify adding the 200 dollars for that. Then you can take the deduction off of, \\[...0.4s\\] alright, so you make the value of the gift card 20% of the price, whatever you wanna sell next. So if it's 200 dollar gift card, you make that 1/5 of the price of 200 \\[...0.9s\\] dollars.If I had a 2,000 dollar off, that be 1/10, but minimum should be 5 x to be 1,000 dollar offer. Obviously, you can make it more expensive than that, you just wanted to be enough that it drives a purchase.Alright, in our example, we sell 200 dollar gift card for 20 bucks. Then apply that 200 dollar offer with at least a thousand dollar price tag people paid or for their friends. Plus you get cash from unused gift cards.Wins all around. That is the gift card play final points, \\[...0.4s\\] roll over up sales credit summer all the customers free purchases towards your next offer. Do roll over upstars.Figure out who to upsell, what's upsell, and how to credit the roll over. Who'd upsell old customers, upset customers, other people's upset customers, current customers.What's upsell more of something better, of something new something new just make sure that you make a profit after applying your discount. How to roll over the credit? You can do full or partial purchase, give it up front, or you can spread it out.We went through examples of all those. You can price your next offer for at least four times higher than the credit, so this makes it a 25% discount. Everything above that is gravy. I wouldn't do less than that. And to get more takers at urgency, make your roll over credit a one time only offer \\[...0.6s\\] and boom, that is the roll of options"
