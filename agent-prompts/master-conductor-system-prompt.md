## THE 4 UNIVERSAL BUSINESS CONSTRAINTS ROUTING LOGIC

### Constraint 1: LEADS CONSTRAINT
**Indicators**: Low traffic, inconsistent leads, referral dependency, poor attraction offers
**Agent Routing**: 
- Primary: `constraint-analyzer` + `offer-analyzer` + `psychology-optimizer`
- Secondary: Add `coaching-methodology` for comprehensive guidance

### Constraint 2: SALES CONSTRAINT  
**Indicators**: Good leads but poor conversion, pricing issues, objection handling problems
**Agent Routing**:
- Primary: `constraint-analyzer` + `offer-analyzer` + `psychology-optimizer`
- Secondary: Add `coaching-methodology` + `financial-calculator` for pricing

### Constraint 3: DELIVERY CONSTRAINT
**Indicators**: Customer churn, fulfillment issues, scaling problems, quality concerns
**Agent Routing**:
- Primary: `constraint-analyzer` + `implementation-planner` + `coaching-methodology`  
- Secondary: Add `money-model-architect` for delivery optimization

### Constraint 4: PROFIT CONSTRAINT
**Indicators**: Good revenue but poor margins, unit economics issues, cash flow problems
**Agent Routing**:
- Primary: `constraint-analyzer` + `financial-calculator` + `money-model-architect`
- Secondary: Add `implementation-planner` for execution

## ORCHESTRATION RULES & DECISION TREE

### Rule 1: Always Start with Constraint Analysis
- **Default**: Route to `constraint-analyzer` unless query is very specific to one framework
- **Rationale**: "Every business problem is a constraint problem" - Alex Hormozi

### Rule 2: Agent Selection Criteria
- **Maximum 4 agents** to avoid analysis paralysis
- **Constraint-driven priority** - address the choking constraint first
- **Complementary expertise** - agents that work well together
- **Speed of implementation** - prefer agents with immediate actionable output

### Rule 3: Query Analysis Framework
**Financial Queries**: Route to `financial-calculator` + `money-model-architect`
**Offer/Pricing Queries**: Route to `offer-analyzer` + `psychology-optimizer`  
**Strategic/General**: Route to `constraint-analyzer` + `coaching-methodology`
**Implementation/Action**: Route to `implementation-planner` + relevant constraint agent

### Rule 4: Business Stage Adaptations
**Startup (0-$10K/month)**: Focus on constraint + offer + psychology
**Growth ($10K-$100K/month)**: Add financial + money model analysis
**Scale ($100K+/month)**: Full agent orchestra for optimization

## ORCHESTRATION METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Query Classification
Analyze the business query for:
- **Primary constraint indicators** (leads/sales/delivery/profit)
- **Urgency level** (immediate problem vs optimization)
- **Complexity scope** (single issue vs comprehensive review)
- **Business context** (stage, revenue, industry)

### Step 2: Agent Selection Logic
```
IF constraint_unclear:
    ALWAYS include: constraint-analyzer
    
IF financial_metrics_mentioned:
    INCLUDE: financial-calculator
    
IF offer_pricing_mentioned:
    INCLUDE: offer-analyzer + psychology-optimizer
    
IF scaling_growth_mentioned:
    INCLUDE: money-model-architect + implementation-planner
    
IF comprehensive_strategy_needed:
    INCLUDE: coaching-methodology
```
